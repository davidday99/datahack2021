            "The term “transatlanticism” was coined by Ben Gibbard to define the incomprehensible emotional gap between two lovers separated by comprehensible distances—the continental United States, an entire ocean, or, most likely, just a couple floors in your freshman dorm. In the 10 years since Death Cab For Cutie released their finest record, the title has taken on an unintended resonance in regards to their career. On one side of their fourth of seven studio albums, there are three modestly performed and admirably successful LPs released on Seattle indie label Barsuk. On the other, three exquisite-sounding and wildly successful LPs released on New York City major...Atlantic. Death Cab’s aesthetic hadn’t really changed all that much, and yet how do you span the distance between the uber-#feelings video for “A Movie Script Ending” and two #1 albums (Codes and Keys hit #3), Grammy nominations, platinum sales when they meant something, huge festival slots, and Zooey Deschanel? Look, it’s nigh impossible to extricate Death Cab’s ascendance from The O.C., so how’s this: from the moment the skyrocket guitars go off in “The New Year”, Death Cab are taking a leap of faith like Seth Cohen up on that kissing booth, risking embarrassment to tell as many people as possible that they may be dorks, but they’re not going to be anyone’s secret anymore.Up until 2001's The Photo Album, Death Cab created often excellent songs that did a limited number of things—they didn’t rock (nor did they really try), they didn’t groove, their blood didn’t run particularly hot either, even when Gibbard sang about abusive parents, any number of lost loves, or hatred for his future hometown of Los Angeles. On album, well, not much really changed. But Walla in particular found countless ways to work around it. We all know Summer Roberts’ “it’s like one guitar and a whole lot of complaining” wisecrack helped Death Cab far more than it ever hurt them, but what always bothered me was the idea that they ever sounded like one guy. Death Cab songs are nearly impossible to accurately recreate in a solo performance and if the rinky-dink demos (hear “We Looked Like Giants” and the title track with 8-bit drums!) included in the reissue prove anything, it’s that.Walla takes advantage of all the band’s moving parts, ensuring each one has its own distinct sonic character and turning album into a downright indulgent listen, a grand buffet of texture and tone. On the whole, the band creates perfectly detailed sonic dioramas—from the piano punctuating the pregnant quietude of “Passenger Seat”, you feel a frozen forest night in the middle of winter. “The New Year” captures explosions off in the distance and the ambivalence of wondering why you can’t relate to them. Within these ornate arrangements, a clever addition sneaks in towards the end and steals the song—the xylophone that rearranges the melody of “Title and Registration”, the combination of handclaps and slashing guitars on “The Sound of Settling”, and especially the percussion, whether those of new drummer Jason McGerr or the mechanistic electronics (beyond its profile boost, the concurrent musical influence of Gibbard’s work in the Postal Service tends to be overstated).It reveals much of their work leading up to album as test runs—the simple Death Cab + drum machine format of “Coney Island” or the Stability EP are upgraded to complex, mixed-meter rhythms on “Lightness” and “name”. On “Bend to Squares”, “Title Track”, “Styrofoam Plates” (and later, “Marching Bands of Manhattan” and “Bixby Canyon Bridge”), Death Cab developed a trick where they’d build and build and build without ever exploding into pure catharsis. The consuming title track unapologetically goes over-the-top, giving you a safe and sound drop on the most sincere, intense FaceTime conversation ever: those glistening guitars and the endless, upward ramp of the drums convey enough infinite sadness as is, and then a church choir comes in to goad the listener: will these two EVER just make out already?Walla was expanding his scope and ambition, intersecting with Gibbard, who was doing the same as a writer. It didn’t initially seem that way: though this record gained Death Cab many, many new fans, it lost some older ones as well, and in our original review of album, William Morris echoed their sentiments, taking issue with the increased generality of Gibbard’s lyrics. And there’s truth to that, as album is full of compact ways to express the same ideas that Death Cab songs would earlier obfuscate with bigger words or dense metaphor: “So this is the new year/ and I don’t feel any different,” “I need you so much closer,” and of course, “She is beautiful, but she don’t mean a thing to me.” That said, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone else capable of pulling off Gibbard’s more typically elliptical concepts. A disastrous wedding “felt just like falling in love again” to the lonely empty nester on “name”. “Title and Registration” begins with a silly joke and it’s revealed as a defense mechanism as Gibbard recalls how the dumbest thing (like, “searching for some legal documents”) can unearth a wellspring of repressed feelings. It’s a phenomenon that can cause you to lose hours at a time, and “Title” sums it up perfectly in four minutes.As a result of pulling all those heartstrings, short of the Decemberists, no band has become an easier target for people who want to assert their “I ain’t with that indie bullshit” masculinity. Granted, Death Cab For Cutie’s music never sounds sexual, and you can’t really call it “rock music” as something derived from “rhythm and blues”—hell, they’ve always been an awkward fit into “emo” as a musical ideal, since that entails some basis in punk and Death Cab clearly have nothing of the sort. And that’s fine, as Gibbard sought to create the definitive songs about the span of a romantic coupling rather than a sonic approximation of it. Whereas the previous albums dealt with mundane, household affairs—reading the unemployment pages, sharing cigarettes, “We Laugh Indoors”—a lot more’s at stake this time out, emotionally and physically. Death Cab thrashes desperately throughout “We Looked Like Giants” while Gibbard recalls both the thrall of hormonal, visceral lust and the painful recollection of the liminal moments spent around jukeboxes and magazines. Wavering sonar beeps cloak low-key amorousness on “Lightness”. And, oh man…\"Tiny Vessels.”A common criticism of Death Cab (and really, its fanbase) is that wimpiness served as a cover for passive-aggressiveness or a safe haven from actually acting on emotions or impulses and risking rejection—if not outright misogyny. “Tiny Vessels” doesn’t exactly negate that criticism, it just forces the issue by putting it right out there. Though he'd reconfigure the “I spent two weeks in Silver Lake” line after his divorce from Zooey Deschanel, that's an exception, as one of Gibbard’s strengths is that his lyrics can be rich with personalized detail without sounding personal. That said, his vocals always lead you to believe that the narrator at least kinda looks like him and it's startling to hear Gibbard detail the kind of callous sexual conquest people think they're escaping by getting into the indie crowd.The entire band is in peak form on \"Tiny Vessels\"—a glancing, sour note in the introductory guitar harmony precedes the unsympathetic admission that you're no different than the narrator, that \"you'll tell her that you love her but you don't.\" Time-elapse layering of shockingly distorted guitars raise the drama during the bridge as he “wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking/ As we moved together in the dark.” That gets most of the attention, though it’s the spellbinding third verse where all of it clears out, leaving plangent, echoing drums that house the monstrous, hollowed-out sentiment of Gibbard’s lyric—that of a total jerk who’s very aware of the thoughts and feelings of the other person, but chooses not to stop himself. It’s understandable that many people either can’t or choose not to acknowledge both sides of “Tiny Vessels”, and every time a Death Cab live crowd turns it to a singalong (and it’s usually one of the loudest), it becomes one of the most biting indictment of “nice guy syndrome” ever written.We’ve gotten this far, so let’s just do away with it: judging Death Cab, and album in particular, from a completely objective standpoint feels kinda insincere and wholly inaccurate (and everybody knows it). From a lot of the descriptors above, “indulgent,” “consuming,” etc.—you can assume that, yeah, I was completely obsessed with album back in 2003. It was in a way that should be embarrassing in retrospect, but why judge your younger self like that? If the “little brother/sister music” tag often applied to Death Cab is going to stick, at least remember the times when your world was that small where new love (or a broken heart) filled its entirety and thensome. Or maybe that a new love shrinks your world to the point where there isn’t room for anything else. Note the central simile in “We Looked Like Giants”, two people “in the back of [a] gray subcompact/ fumbling to make contact” don’t have a lot of space to consider politics, socioeconomic struggle, whatever you consider to be “important” matters for art to discern.I mean, I can bust out a map and point out the mountain passes of Virginia’s I-64 that I’d brave after skipping early classes or talk about the resonance of “Title and Registration” in relation to the November day in 2003 I spent getting my automotive legal documents in order or how I first heard the title track on the way to a college reunion, for crying out loud. Serendipity, for sure—but few records open themselves up to forge those kind of moments, to be a formative emotional and listening experience, pushing you to feel what you’re thinking (to flip a line from “Lightness”), daring to be universal enough to allow you to see yourself in it. If you love this album, or will, you’ll have some a personal history of your own and that’s why album stands out over Death Cab’s impressive catalog—they were always great at telling you stories, but here, they proved even better at helping you understand your own.\n",
            "With regard to ambient music, it can seem that looking is as important a part of the experience as listening. The details become meaningful as they drain into the visual world, saturating it. The effect is uniquely powerful outdoors, as though the music, having been extracted from nature, replenishes its intensity. The sky seems bluer and more finely graded, uniquely composed against the dark treetops. You feel a significance in a lone contrail, a cosmic purpose in a pattern of light and shade. Ambient musicians have diligently reinforced these visual associations, shoring up abstract flutters and waves with sturdy images of mountains, forests, seas, and stars.This is why album may be the perfect ambient band name, arranging the indifferent sky in proportion to the solitary witness who gives it meaning. The duo's long-gestating debut easily calls to mind drenching sunrises, glittering constellations, and sailing clouds, richly furnishing the familiar sense of hovering over vast natural orders that you're also inside. But while the music is effective and finely wrought, it's slightly checked by the same schematic feel as the group's name. Mannered, well-balanced gloriousness doesn't allow much room for surprise, and pat postcard vistas start to intrude before the album exhausts its considerable length.  album is Jonas Munk, who records ambient glitch music as Manual, and Jason Kolb, guitarist for the shoegaze band Auburn Lull. Reportedly, this record is the result of years of online audio file swapping, and it shows in a compulsive lack of stray hairs; an obsessive attention to proportion and timbre. It was created largely with analog sources and electric guitars, recorded live and then processed into glowing smears, periodic spasms of rhythm, filaments of texture. Only rarely, notably on \"Ambros\", does anything like the liquid shredding of Fripp and Eno's seminal ambient guitar music emerge. The guitar processing more resembles Fennesz or Stars of the Lid, refracting minimal harmonic material through a tonal prism.The music is often pillowy and edgeless, with even its handful of rougher textures yoked into a slow, interpenetrating tumble. Soft bass and a metallic twist play through the high, mottled drone of \"Slow Billows\", depth-charges seem to boom through the unusually bracing \"Dim Language\", and \"Helsinki Radio\" takes a fine comb to the tonality and grain of, you guessed it, static. More often, we get subtle variations on certain durable timbres, such as the heavenly chorus pouring through the clouds of \"Calumet\" or the faux-strings-and-winds of \"Pankalia\".You have to mill down the over-familiar language to hear the standouts, such as \"Kronstadt\", which has an enchanting feel of slowed down, staggered plainsong. But passages of quiet inspiration are diluted by inundation. After working on it for so long, you can understand why Munk and Kolb overstuffed the record, but it might have benefitted from losing the excessively long, three-part \"Bilocation\" suite at the end-- at least if the second part didn't bring a welcome rhythmic jolt to the placid motion. I'm left wondering if ambient music's connection to nature has become simply reflexive. There is something hall-of-mirrors-like about it: stars actually do make sounds, which resemble the ones ambient musicians synthesize for looking at stars. One starts to yearn for a break in the circuit. Long, revolving tones make for easy cosmic or biospheric allegories, but with a little more daring and imagination, couldn't they conjure all kinds of other things as well?\n",
            " The second album by Canadian singer/songwriter Lullaby Baxter hints at multiple pasts and a candy-coated, just-out-of-reach future. The title, Garden Cities of To-morrow, is a reference to British urban planner Ebenezer Howard's 1902 tome of the same name, which laid out a futuristic vision of communities that married town and country life in a single setting. Howard was also an avid Esperanto speaker and is partly responsible for inspiring Disney's Epcot. Baxter's jazzy alto, meanwhile, carries echoes of singers like Ella Fitzgerald, with a sprinkle of pixie dust rather than the venti cappuccino smoothness of such like-minded chanteuses as Norah Jones and Madeline Peyroux. Pop duo Hercules, who produce, lavish Baxter's songs with the 1960s baroque-pop perfectionism of their overlooked 2004 album, In the Alleyway. Garden Cities of To-morrow lacks the touches of artful noise that intermittently added texture to In the Alleyway, though a few storm-like tendrils do strike the lounge penguin-cruise of \"Antarctica\". Hercules' Peter Baldwin and Ben Sumner are like French duo Air with a yen for orchestras instead of synths and fewer TV commercial gigs. Flugelhorn leans against shy acoustic guitars on \"Little Song\", while standout \"Sugar\" opens with pulsing \"I Am the Walrus\" Mellotron before dissolving in country-rock lead guitar licks, delirious strings, whirling Wurlitzer, and ostinato bass line. A flute quartet, harp, timpani, marimba, and even djembe dress up other tracks in full Herculean garb, with Ennio Morricone's flair for the cinematic. Baxter herself carries on the quirky yet sophisticated style of her 2000 debut Capable Egg, with one foot in over-the-rainbow whimsy and the other in the contemporary singer/songwriter tradition. She's prone to eccentric figurative language that straddles the line between endearing and irritating, depending on your taste: the relatively spare \"Cardboard Armoured Car\" is full of 'em, culminating in \"The world is my potato,\" while the most Jones-like track here, \"Fontana Fontaine\", jumps from \"you loved me like a circus\" to \"good old Kansas City\". She gets the mixture just right on the aforementioned \"Sugar\": \"Cursed at the moon/ 'til you both turned blue\", as Wurlitzer bends nostalgia into pathos. Garden Cities of To-morrow is an acquired taste: both too weird and too ordinary at once, but when Baxter matches her urbane oddities and Hercules' pastoral popscaping just right, it's like a stroll through leafy, tree-lined city blocks in early autumn twilight. While Baldwin and Sumner have yet to work with songs that perfectly suit their approach, this album's best moments set their distinctive arrangements alongside bits of jazz and fairytale magic, a masterwork of urban planning for a city out of an enchanted kingdom. Not Epcot, though. \n",
            "In recent years, everyone from Death From Above 1979 to Architecture in Helsinki to Bloc Party have succumbed to the temptation to create indie remix albums. Now we're faced with Stars' album?, which we may someday see as the tipping point from indie rock remix albums being idle, indulgent fan-club novelties to becoming inescapable annoyances. Helpfully, it gathers all the transgressions of the trend into one convenient package: incestuous choice of collaborators, unimaginative use of technology, and reconfiguration that uniformly fails to improve on the originals. It also ups the criminal ante by revisiting, track-by-track, an album that's already three years old (Set Yourself on Fire) and splitting the time between flimsy remixes and lazy covers; in other words, Stars has commissioned their own tribute album. The sheer egotism is the most impressive thing about it. Final Fantasy's leadoff take on \"Your Ex-Lover is Dead\" sets the tone, lying limply between remix and cover. Preserving Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan's vocals, Owen Pallett fills in the rest with waltzy piano and random string bursts that seem fairly oblivious to the song, sounding more like an audition to be Jon Brion's film-soundtrack intern than a new take on a song that was already more effectively cinematic to begin with. And Pallett's not the only one who utilizes the \"hey let's attach the original vocal track to whatever random shit we have lying around\" method, as the Most Serene Republic short-circuit the glistening synth-pop of \"Ageless Beauty\" by layering Millan's singing over an aimless acoustic jam, and the Stills use \"Soft Revolution\" as a riff-and-solo trashcan, with a horrible pan-flute solo as frosting. Even when the covers sound less like a band cleaning out their hard drive, the reinterpretations misunderstand Stars' appeal and strengths. Both Apostle of Hustle's slack \"One More Night\" and the Russian Futurists' breakbeat-and-power-chord \"The First Five Times\" over-masculinize the sleepy and sensitive Stars sound, while retaining none of their romantic grandeur. Only Broken Social Scene alumnus Jason Collett's top-to-bottom remake of \"Reunion\" offers any sort of surprising alternate take, turning the song into a ragged, Stonesy number that's far enough afield of Stars' usual M.O. to justify the makeover. In the actual remix department, there are multiple examples of the most common rearrangement gaffes. Camouflage Nights' \"Celebration Guns\" and the Dears' \"What I'm Trying to Say\" (inexplicably split into two parts) both commit the crime of reproduction, with new versions mostly adhering to the originals' structure and sounds and merely moving the sonic furniture around a bit (\"hey, what if the chorus drumbeat was the drumbeat for the verses!\"). Then there are the tracks that are completely electronified, but to little result, like the Junior Boys' phoned-in \"Sleep Tonight\", perhaps the most promising (given the Boys' remix know-how), and therefore disappointing, track on Friends. Minotaur Shock (with \"The Big Fight\") and Metric (\"He Lied About Death\") at least get a little ambitious, but both leave the oven undercooked, the former rendered somewhat uncomfortable by gallons of empty space, and the latter fixated like a third-grader on the swear-word lyric \"don't fuck with our lives\" as it runs a psych-loop treadmill. All together, album? is an ideal demonstration of why the trend of indie rock remix records should be snuffed out before they becomes industry standard. While we understand the urge to create this kind of stopgap project, either as a way to keep an artist's name in the newswire, a chance to make some extra pocket change with minimal work, or an opportunity to promote some musical pals, as an artistic statement these releases almost uniformly fail to creatively re-imagine any of the source material, only serving to fill the market with inferior versions. Ideally, indie bands will restrict their remixing impulses to B-sides and blog leaks, utilize artists with some experience and talent in the art, and spare us from the feeble, immaterial album-length likes of Friends. \n",
            " There's something disquieting at the bottom of the Black Swans' songs, something half-shaped and half-seen, like a body in a lake. The surface of the music is usually calm and familiar, but something disturbing appears briefly in the crest of each wave of violin or guitar. On the emphatically titled album, their second full-length and first for La Société Expéditionnaire, that something might be dread, or fear, or some secret intelligence about which the band write and play but can never disclose. It's the same something that haunted their debut, Who Will Walk in the Darkness with You?, and their follow-up EP, Sex Brain. Paradoxically, album doesn't actually change any of their mysterious intent, but amplifies it. Crisper and more pared down than their previous releases, albeit with slightly less variation among the songs, album sounds luminously cinematic, like Pinetop Seven or the soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, yet twilit songs like \"name\", \"Purple Heart\", and even the silvertoned instrumental \"Blue Moon #9\" use these familiar sounds for foreign ends-- they're not simply dark, but cleverly dreadful, as if the Black Swans are smuggling something sinister inside the lyrics and chords. Jerry DeCicca's voice still sounds hollowed at its core, deep yet light, with that eerie vibrato that draws comparisons to Stuart Staples of Tindersticks, but with a country bent instead of soul. His and Christopher Forbes' deep Americana guitars still walk in the darkness with Noel Sayres' scratchily emotive violin, the head to the latter's heart. Bassist Canaan Faulkner and drummer Keith Hanlon know to hang back, recognizing that rhythm on these songs must be subliminal at best. Even when the melodies verge on lovely, which they do on every song, they still sound uneasy. The Black Swans may be trafficking in a kind of atmospheric indie folk-rock, but album actually plays like a sort of blues, full of thoroughly digested worry and world-weariness: \"There's a dark cloud hanging over,\" DeCicca sings on \"Shake\", \"and trouble on my mind.\" It's not that the Black Swans inhabit a strange world, but that they depict the real world from such a strange perspective. These songs portray crossroads, where weird metamorphoses are taking place, as DeCicca describes changing from one self into another. \"This is my new face,\" he sings on opener \"New Face\", \"I wear it for you.\" Or consider the grim physicality of \"Coats\", sung over a rising and falling guitar melody: \"My skin is paint, watch it flake/ Pick up the brush, fix the mistake.\" So that album title turns out to be a dire exclamation, like yelling Help! or Watch out!, and album eventually reveals itself to be a break-up album, where the end of a relationship necessitates traumatic transformation. As DeCicca sings on the title track, \"All that's left is change.\" Period. \n",
            "Big Star aren't just rock's greatest cult band; they were arguably rock's first cult band. Like Magellan, they discovered a new route to iconic status, but theirs was more circuitous and didn't involve such niceties as sales, audience, tours, or really anything resembling actual success. Instead, they maintained a slow, dim burn throughout the 1970s and 80s, their memory kept alive by critics, collectors, record store clerks, and younger generations of musicians such as R.E.M. and the Replacements. It's easy to read that history in the band name and album titles, which today play like ironic gestures toward out-of-reach celebrity. But Big Star were sincere about being artists and having #1 records. They didn't set out to be cult: Striving for celebrity and confirmation, they wrote what they thought should be hit records, and they played to please. Their appeal should and could have been broad. By comparison, their loyal audience nearly forty years later is a fluke.Despite their unprecedented longevity and surprising durability, Big Star have been under-anthologized, with a strange string of lackluster releases. Alex Chilton's pre-band solo debut, 1970, took more than 15 years to make its way to record store shelves, and the band's first two albums, #1 Record and Radio City, have been joined at the hip now for decades, starting with the British combo release in 1978 throughout Fantasy/Concord's recent remaster. Big Star's final album, Third/Sisters Lovers, gathered dust for nearly five years before finally getting a small release, and even that tribute album was delayed for nearly a decade. During that time, The Best of Big Star and Big Star Story tried foolishly to whittle the band's short career down to one negligible disc.Combining studio tracks, live cuts, demos, and unreleased recordings to reveal new sides of the band, Rhino' 4xCD Keep an Eye on the Sky sounds like the one reissue that finally gets Big Star right. It picks up right before the band formed, with solo tracks from both Chris Bell and Chilton as well as songs from previous bands Rock City and Icewater (the Box Tops are missing, and certainly not necessary to the story). Each iteration of the line-up is represented here, although there's nothing from 1993's comeback Columbia: Live at Missouri University or from 2005's already forgotten In Space. This set wisely keeps its eye on the 70s.These four discs ultimately do what any good box set should do: In tracing the band's trajectory from power-pop progenitors to post-pop tinkerers, Keep an Eye on the Sky presents a history of the band that could not be gleaned from the albums themselves, using finished studio tracks along with demos and rarities to give a fuller picture of the musicians, their dynamic, and their songs. This type of repetition can be fatal in some reissues, either offering distinctions only a true diehard could love or valiantly covering up a deficit of unreleased material. But here, the approach goes a long way toward humanizing a band that has been largely mythologized even into the Internet age. You can listen in on band practice or late-night jam sessions at Ardent, or just wander across happenstance pairings, such as Chilton singing \"Nature Boy\" while William Eggleston-- yes, that William Eggleston-- plays piano. That these new versions of familiar songs feed the cult rather than expunge the mystery is perhaps due to Ardent founder and engineer John Fry, whose studio work brings out the subtle flourishes in these different takes: the handclaps on the sped-up version of \"O My Soul\", the rich strums that underline the chorus of \"The Ballad of El Goodo\", the crisp guitar sound that gives \"You Get What You Deserve\" its bite. He's the fifth Big Star, as crucial to these early recordings as George Martin was to the Beatles or Martin Hannett was to Joy Division. Big Star developed its particular sound in a very short time. The first notes of \"Feel\", the #1 Record opener, still sound like a clarion call, a signal that something exciting is about to go down. They live up to that promise through their first two albums, but on their third, with Bell and bass player Andy Hummel gone, Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens gradually disassemble that power-pop sound, seemingly indulging every oddball impulse: jive-talking through \"You Can't Have Me\" and \"Kizza Me\", adding French-language backing vocals to the Velvet Underground's \"Femme Fatale\", writing a paean to Jesus Christ. Third and its outtakes show Big Star in its death throes, giving up on the idea of power pop to the people and just making strange, sad, beautiful songs for themselves. \"Holocaust\" in particular, especially the haunting piano demo here, is devastating in its damaged beauty.Keep an Eye on the Sky ends with a cuts from three concerts recorded at a small Memphis club in 1973, featuring the original line-up minus Bell. They run through songs from the first two albums, including jammy performances of \"She's a Mover\" and \"Don't Lie to Me\" as well as covers of T. Rex, the Kinks, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and Todd Rundgren. It's a strong show, a better glimpse at Big Star the live band than any of their actual live albums, but what stands out is the relative lack of audience response. Big Star were opening for Archie Bell & the Drells, and it's clear that the crowd was already impatient with the first act. As a result, it sounds like Big Star are playing to an empty room, which feels thematically appropriate. People wouldn't start clapping until many years later.\n",
            "On their first two albums (1998's Gangstabilly and 1999's Pizza Deliverance), the Drive-By Truckers were supreme redneck jokesters, specializing in scabrous white-trash vignettes owing more to Southern Gothic fiction (Flannery O'Connor, Barry Hannah) than any sub-Mason-Dixon stand-up hacks. As the band matured and its de facto frontman Patterson Hood started writing songs that were weightier and more universal in sentiment, however, its more darkly off-kilter early work came to be generally viewed as juvenilia, the dicking around these guys did before they grew up into real artists. That would be a mistake, because songs like \"18 Wheels of Love\", \"Bulldozers and Dirt\", and \"Zoloft\" were wickedly clever and deeply revealing slices of Southern life that hold relatable truths for all listeners regardless of region. That said, it's a refreshing surprise that the group's latest album, album, finds Hood reconnecting with the macabre, with grim twists and booze-fueled mayhem, and with the dark corners of the American psyche.The album begins morbidly with \"Daddy Learned to Fly\", its whining riff propelling the first-person reflections of a young boy whose father has died. It's a colorful kind of morbidity, however, as we learn the boy has been eased into an acceptance of loss by the creative lie that his father is perpetually flying the friendly skies. Weighing the most deadly serious facts of life against a highly skewed sense of irreverence has always been one of DBT's greatest feats, and it's a balancing act the group maintains throughout the album's raucous first half-- on the booze-fueled bottoming-out of \"Fourth Night of My Drinking\", the small-town sex scandal of the portentously delivered \"The Wig He Made Her Wear\", and the nasty little slice of backwater intrigue called \"Drag the Lake Charlie\".It's a damn good thing Hood drops some of his gravitas, too, because his partner in crime, Mike Cooley (aka the Trucker you've always been able to rely on for witty shit-kickers) inexplicably contributes only three songs out of album's 13. Two of the three are great, as \"Birthday Boy\" offers up the musings of a savvy stripper while \"Get Downtown\" provides a shaggy snapshot of no-account losers outfitted to a shucking Chuck Berry groove. Still, that leaves quite a heavy burden on Hood's shoulders, even after you account for a couple of very nice turns from bassist Shonna Tucker, who was a bit of a weak link on Creation's Dark but who chills the blood here on the heartrending, hymnlike \"You Got Another\", then sets it racing again on the full-throated \"(It's Gonna Be) I Told You So\".To his credit, Hood's restored mischievousness manages to carry the album for quite some time, but he starts to falter along the record's back stretch. \"This Fucking Job\" and \"After the Scene Dies\" are sonically torqued-up and admirably pissed-off, but their respective gripes against occupational drudgery and the death of the rock'n'roll dream represent well-trodden ground for this songwriter. album then proceeds to bow out rather unceremoniously with the relative whimpers of \"Santa Fe\", \"The Flying Wallendas\", and Cooley's sweet but tepid \"Eyes Like Glue\". The Truckers demonstrated with 2008's Brighter Than Creation's Dark that they don't need non-stop yuks and grotesqueries to reach greatness, but the best moments of album nonetheless offer tantalizing proof that these guys still possess fascinatingly warped minds when they feel like showing 'em off.\n",
            "There's no sense in burying the lead: This is album's second solo album for Kill Rock Stars and, yes, he still sounds like a woman; often uncannily so. Which is not to say that Hanson's a fey moonchild in the style of a Marc Bolan or Devendra Banhart, nor does he channel the powerhouse androgyny of Boy George or Antony and the Johnsons. Nevertheless, when his voice first emerges nearly a minute into the ravishing slow-burn of the opening \"Losing a Year\", its tone is breathy and angelic enough to make Art Garfunkel sound like Bon Scott, and so startlingly feminine that you might jump to verify that you haven't cued up a lost Cat Power record by mistake. Once the initial shock of his vocal timbre subsides, however, Hanson's meditative arrangements and skillful pop craftsmanship come to the fore, and underpin the album with artful, dazzling folk-rock that recalls the heady, early-70s L.A. orchestrations of Joni Mitchell or Judee Sill. Expanding ambitiously on the expressive sincerity of his 2003 solo debut Son, Hanson has here decked his songs out in full chamber-pop regalia. With assistance from co-producer and arranger A.J. Mogis-- who has previously lent his various talents to such acts as Bright Eyes, Rilo Kiley, and the Faint-- most of the tracks on album veritably drip with vibrant layers of piano, violin, accordion, and cello, giving the album a sumptuous breadth of detail. The most obvious recent touchstone is Elliott Smith's XO, but throughout the album Hanson displays the exquisite patience and subtlety to allow his songs to blossom gradually which, coupled with his extraordinary voice, should help establish him wholly as an artist of distinction. Built on a base of fiercely strummed acoustic guitar, the aforementioned \"Losing a Year\" climbs methodically over the course of nearly eight minutes before cresting in a spirited full-group swell, while tracks like \"Welcome Here\" and \"Long Overdue\" are constructed around lush, two-fisted piano chords that carry the snap and jangle of vintage AM gold. Hanson showcases some deft folk picking on quieter cuts like \"Now We Know\" or \"Let You Out\" that, though they wouldn't have sounded out of place on Son, still possess an animated Rubber Soul appeal. And on \"This Time It Will\" he even takes a pass at sprightly alt-country, its breezy twang clipping along briskly like a colt out for its morning run. As with his previous work, seemingly every song here sets about the gentle archeology of brushing the sand from past relationships to re-examine every minute detail, with each track addressed to some nameless \"you.\" At times this can give album a certain uncomfortable sense of personal invasion, but perhaps this feeling is just a natural effect of Hanson's entrancing voice, an otherworldly instrument likely able to make nearly anything sound as intimate as a lover's whisper.\n",
            "On his commentary track for Failure's 2004 longform retrospective video Golden, bassist/guitarist Greg Edwards recalls the time that Steve Albini \"schooled me in how screwed I was for the rest of my life\" after signing a record deal. Albini, Edwards adds, \"wasn't totally wrong.\" Maybe so, but Edwards was lucky in the sense that Failure never actually sold enough units to get swindled out of much. Moreover, Slash (then a Warner subsidiary that had retained some of its indie spirit) gave the L.A. space-rock/alt-metal trio an unusually wide berth when it came to creative control. The label even allowed Edwards and co-bandleader Ken Andrews to self-produce their 1996 opus Fantastic Planet, a sleeper classic that attracted a cult following after the band broke up in '97.With its dense layers of guitar distortion, gusts of compressed cymbal wash, and near-70 minute runtime, Fantastic Planet bears the familiar hallmarks of the CD era it was conceived in. But other than a longstanding affiliation with Tool, Ken Andrews and Greg Edwards didn't relate to the grunge-alternative paradigm at all. With album, their first new LP in 19 years, they—along with returning drummer Kellii Scott—make a self-conscious attempt to revisit the scale and feel of Fantastic Planet. On the surface, that seems like a capitulation, but they manage to pull off the near-impossible feat of establishing continuity with their back catalog while also giving listeners a glimpse of what the band might have sounded like had it stayed together, and evolved organically up to this point. Edwards and Andrews went on to make more elastic music in Autolux and ON, respectively, but album reminds us of how synergistic their creative bond was—and still is. Once again, Andrews brings most of the riff-oriented guitar and bass parts, vocal melodies, and engineering to the table, while Edwards contributes the more impressionistic bass and guitar ideas, as well as lyrics and a classic producer's sense of oversight. It doesn't take long for the magic spark between them to make itself apparent. On \"Hot Traveler\", for example, a plodding, metallic march dissolves into a dreamlike, suspended-gravity passage, as graceful as a field of fireflies on a summer night. On the other hand, the bridge of \"A.M. Amnesia\" benefits from what Edwards and Andrews have obviously learned during their time apart—i.e: art-damaged atmospheres à la Autolux and quasi-soulful bedside falsetto cooing reminiscent of Andrews' solo work. (\"Soulful\" was the last thing you'd have called Andrews in '94, when he was belting out acid-fried lines about enlarged cockroaches and dead boys in dumpsters on Failure's sophomore effort Magnified.) Of course, these new sonic touches resonate more deeply thanks to the album's overarching lyrical themes. Just like in 1996, Edwards and Andrews anchor the music in a rich subtext that threads the songs together into a Pink Floyd-ian, almost topographical journey fit for headphones and extended bouts of sitting in your room with the lights off. In short, where Fantastic Planet (partially inspired by the 1973 René Laloux film of the same name) used outer space imagery as a vehicle to express Edwards' heroin-addled feelings of spiritual dislocation, album shifts focus from outer to inner space and probes the deeper mysteries of sleep. The band spends the bulk of the album's 18 tracks exploring dreams, consciousness, memory, and the dissolution of self. Song after song after song, it's clear that Edwards and Andrews haven't lost their gift for walking the line between cerebral and dark. And it's precisely that charge of intellectual stimulation—spiked with an ever-so-subtle creep factor—that makes album such a thrilling ride.Somewhat surprisingly, though, Failure circa 2015 engages most when it departs from the driving riff-rock that landed it on the map in the first place. \"Counterfeit Sky\", for example, rubberizes the band's penchant for dissonance and stretches it into a slinkier, sexier sound. And then, in the most striking wtf?… wait, this could actually be working! moment, the piano-driven \"Mulholland Dr.\" literally sounds as if it could've walked off of From the Inside, Alice Cooper's 1978 album with three of Elton John's bandmates and John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. Meanwhile, album contains no less than six ambient interludes. A whole separate album in that style would've been nice, but even in truncated form the interludes cast Philip Glass-ian shades onto the other songs and suggest that Failure's creativity is far from exhausted.Finally, there's \"I Can See Houses\", a song that pre-dates the band's 1992 debut Comfort. Prior to this version, only one, chatting-marred recording existed. But even without Edwards' fretless-bass flourishes that define the character of the original, the new \"Houses\" swells into a more sublime, highly finessed vision—the perfect mirror, in fact, for how Failure's sound has blossomed across the board. By reviving its the past, Failure has taken a most decisive step into the present. \n",
            "Over the last few years, Alchemist has made the successful transformation from A-list beat provider to down-for-whatever oddball. Cooking up \"GTAV\" cuts alongside Oh No with one hand and wrangling up wild prog-psych headnod beat-tapes with the other, he somehow still has enough in the tank to work with everyone from Curren$y to Domo Genesis to Prodigy and to fuel idiosyncratically great supergroup projects like Gangrene, Step Brothers, and Durag Dynasty. It's an understated portfolio, but an amazing one, and it should elevate him out of the \"recommended if you like Madlib\" pantheon onto anyone's short list of greats. album (eesh, that title) is another notch in the belt, even if it's kind of a shallow one—after all, it's only 20 minutes long. But since Alc's spent so much of his free (and paid) time plunging into the weirdo-sample abyss, even his less-substantial stuff finds a way to cohere. This time, it's through a dense patchwork of clipped soundbites, which offer alerts about train-derailing kids (\"Retarded Alligator\"), acid trip narratives (\"name\"), missives taken from '70s flicks like Black Caesar (\"Muscular Infant\") and The Gravy Train (\"Kirk Fuckin Douglas\"). These loosely connected pop-cultural riffs on power, money, drugs, violence, and corruption echo in some of Alc's jittery beats, like the four-note suspense-sting keyboards on \"Muscular Infant\" and a thousand-yard-stare of an acid-blues guitar lick on \"Seven Minutes\".album is over in a flash, a bunch of ephemeral tracks that hint at the wider, weirder stuff Alchemist's been doing this decade. But even on a snapshot of an album like this, he can't keep from letting his love of headknock beats shine through. The 8-millimeter piano chords on \"Jane Meets Chrissy\", choppy loops of \"Holy Tabernacle\", and sizzling '70s synthesizer noodling of \"Drug Break\" all have some authoritative drum breaks underneath. That goes double for \"Voodoo\", the only rap track and one of numerous opportunities Alchemist has given Action Bronson to be unpredictably outlandish (\"I'm not fat, I'm only robust/ Crash the Jeep into your crib until it blows up\").So with all that recent and omnipresent work going for him, how badly would you really need an EP-length mostly-instrumental mix of his, especially so soon after last month's fantastic Israeli Salad? I mean, yeah, it's got a coloring-book cover if you're into that kind of novelty (drawn by Nick Gazin, the guy behind the Run the Jewels artwork), but otherwise we're not hurting for Alchemist releases. Still, getting a little slice more is fine, really. What with being put out on his own odds-and-ends-heavy label and having a pretty low-stakes whateverish feel to it, album is a fun diversion that feels like it was made in an afternoon, not out of some kind of first-draft laziness, but because Alchemist's gotten to the point where the trip from inspiration to production feels more-or-less instantaneous.\n",
            " The Long Winters frontman-cum-producer John Roderick may have spent formative years in Anchorage, Alaska but there’s nothing overtly chilly about the Seattle quartet’s third full-length, Putting the Days to Bed. Never mind that on “Hindsight” Roderick deliberates about holding a snowball of a girl and croons about “craving the sun” (all in that crazy awesome voice of his: part dude from Okkervil River, part Craig Finn), this stuff’s about as wintry as possible, arriving mid-summer as balmy noise for the heat-waved and bummed vacation-reeling. Since 2002’s The Worst You Can Do Is Harm, the Long Winters have made names for themselves as purveyors of hard-to-pigeonhole, mostly likeable-- if not staunchly consistent-- pop. The back-to-back bounciness(es) of “Fire Island, AK” and “Teaspoon” on Putting the Days to Bed are further proof of the band’s leanings toward not so much power pop or even necessarily powerful pop-- just powered up pop, all horns and echoes and toe-tapping parties. But emotional pick-me-ups these aren’t, per se: With Roderick, everything’s about “me” and “you,” either angsty correspondence/confrontation or words to the wise. “(It’s a) Departure” finds him explaining, “I like the old days/ But not all the old days/ Only the good old days”: With Putting the Days to Bed, L-Dubs’ trademark aural cheeriness hasn’t vanished-- if anything, it’s even upped-- but Roderick’s songwriting, here, is at its best and maybe bleakest. Lyrically, the album concerns itself with let-downs and hard truths concerned with what suckers humans really are: sad affinities for self-destruction (on “Hindsight” he asks “Is this new move just to keep moving?” and bails water out of a pretty but dilapidated boat because he likes the shape of it) and insatiable idealism and whatever. On “Honest,” at the album’s center, a mother tells her daughter: “Honest, it’s all right to be a singer, but don’t you love a singer, whatever you do” followed by what sounds like a choir reiterating “whatever you do”, like an updated “Que Sera” for a would-be groupie. Lines off Putting the Days to Bed are mostly hit or miss (misses come across as standard, petty gripes) but at their finest, they’re beautiful: “Did you see me the way I imagined? Every eyelash a picket or a wire?” The most anthemic and orchestral approach something only one stop shy of the grandiose gloom of \"Do You Realize?\" and the Long Winters are closer than they've ever been to perfectly executing the huge sounding sad song. Still, they miss the masterful mark: Maybe it’s that there are too many wannabe huge songs stuck side-by-side, maybe they’re dwarfed in the process, maybe those kamikaze echoes wind up more grating than agreeable. Regardless, Putting the Days to Bed is a solid effort-- a step in a promising new direction. \n",
            "One can practically hear the crickets chirping in Clearlake's songs, so sylvan is their dreamy brit-rock. album, the band's third album, pits ostentatious instrumentation against a druthers for fiery guitar squall, elements they've never meshed this harmoniously before. Frequently gorgeous but over-lubed, the album forges soundscapes so lush they're almost narcotic. In a British rock scene suddenly governed by sexually frustrated Sheffield kids with a Lavigne-shallow understanding of the anvils on which they stand, album's yawns are a nice respite from the geeky frissons now being purveyed. The Hove foursome (bummer no Carters among them) come off mellow and sure-footed, maybe a little paternal. The band remembers life before Oasis, even before industrialization: album's best songs imagine atavistic, Tolkien-esque habitats, happily ignorant of history's looming smogsets. Even the title invites eco-friendly readings. You'd expect any album with such profligate nods to nature, and how cool it is, and how the modern world is scary, of packing an ideological strain. But frontman Jason Pegg spouts lover's vitriol as diligently as he casts granola melancholy. Risking sounding like a crybaby on Christmas, \"I Hate It That I Got What I Wanted\" details a strange affliction: remorse over getting what one wants. Pegg's reasoning? \"I don't want it anymore.\" Fair 'nuff. Yet the words don't bother so much as the way they're delivered, Pegg essaying uptempo snarl, getting smothered by those \"whoa, dude, let it ring!\" Road Rash guitars. Better is the topsy-turvy \"It's Getting Light Outside\", whose pistoning, tympani-heavy rhythm provides a good context for Pegg's nasally, overearnest sing-song. \"You Can't Have Me\", even softer-hued, plays fuzzy gegenschein to the more importunate yowlers; the Fennesz-wet upbeat guitar pulses can't not encourage nostalgic reverie. Another way album foils expectations: For a band with such imaginative whimsy, Clearlake have a disappointingly staid invasion jones. \"name\" does its scuzziest nth-wave stomp, complete with tactical tambourine jiggles, aloof vox harmonies, and an insultingly simple guitar lick; cowbell's a continental aberration, probably a Pixies reference. Even worse is single \"Neon\", whose booming drum-and-harmonica rig wants to be Big & Rich, not fey British indie rockers. The album really shines when it's at its quietest, like when Pegg quavers trying to bridge the wide gap between \"Dreamt That You Died\"'s baggy guitar chords. Never mind the song recycles Cedars standout \"Trees in the City\", only this time on some macabre quasi-personal folderol, not the original's unambiguous anti-concrete screed. Plugged-in but still drowsy, \"It's Getting Light Outside\" is the real gem, though, mainly because it understands that volume does not equate to energy in recorded music: post-chorus guitar spikes provide a twist-of-lime kick without rising above library volume. A word to British rock in '06: The frissons are great, but let's have more yawns.\n",
            "It's easy to get lost in the sea of ink around dubstep. It goes back to UK garage, which goes back to drum'n'bass, which goes back to house, techno, hip hop, and reggae. A DJ can play four-on-the-floor kicks, thudding half-speed beats, double-time breakbeats, Southern hip-hop 808 beats, dubby bass lines, heavy metal-ish distorted synths, Detroit techno chord stabs, and blissed-out atmospheric washes, and it can all be considered dubstep. Critics love this. Ergo, acres of blog posts and lifetimes of DJ mixes waxing academic about dubstep's sub-sub-strains. Writing and music and dancing and architecture have never been more conflated.For all the talk of dubstep as future music, it is stubbornly recombinant. Dubstep is filled with drum'n'bass sounds from the last decade. Burial, dubstep's big crossover success, was/is essentially house producer Todd Edwards through a druggy haze. Many tout album, a UK producer, as the next Burial. This is true in that his debut album is not a bunch of disposable DJ singles, but rather a coherent statement suited for home listening. But it's false in that album sounds quite different. Unlike Burial, he uses vocals sparingly. When he does, they are textures and hardly recognizable as vocals. This goes about things the hard way-- people (especially critics) love vocals-- but it goes further. A sad song feels sadder if it doesn't tell you that it's sad. This album is not future music. It is one of the saddest things you'll ever hear. Its tears come now, not later.This album has actually been made before. In 2003, English breaks producer Tipper released an album called Surrounded. It set cavernous bass and desolate textures atop low-impact hip hop beats. This sound was once called trip-hop; Massive Attack's 100th Window was comparable in its digital isolation. album's album is similar, though it has traits that will date it as a product of 2009 -- some gently swung garage here, some half-time dubstep there.Like much of dubstep, this record makes for a fun game of \"spot the influence.\" The spacey atmospherics of \"Birth Interlude\" harken back to the heyday of LTJ Bukem's Good Looking Records. The bleary dystopia of \"name\" recalls neurofunk drum'n'bass like Hidden Agenda and Ed Rush & Optical. \"Lucid Dream\" and \"Sempiternal\" feature languid drum'n'bass two-step beats and hoover bass lines. But for all its influences, this record is remarkably singular. Its sounds coalesce into a feeling for which words would do injustice. Perhaps it's fatigue; after drum'n'bass' aggression has spent itself, it rolls back its frequencies and rumbles quietly and alone. Perhaps it's wistfulness; all these fog horns and bird calls and musty washes are memories from dancefloors past. Perhaps it's loneliness; after a lifetime of information processing, which in today's Internet age can take but months, one yearns to go outside and meet a fellow soul.\n",
            "Drug abuse was as rampant in the Seattle scene as frayed flannel shirts, and few local artists chronicled junkie conflicts quite so persistently as Layne Staley. As frontman for Alice in Chains, he approached the subject with a cagey ambivalence that allowed that band to navigate from glam metal also-rans to grunge grunge mainstays. Drugs were a temptation as well as a burden, and at his best Staley implied that addiction prodded the scene’s severe introversion-- as if that was the pain that everyone was singing about. At his worst, though, he could be ridiculously self-righteous and pompously poetic about his habit. If you don’t believe me, read the lyrics to “Junkhead”.After Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and journeyman bass player John Baker Saunders met at rehab and formed a band, they brought in Staley primarily because they thought he would benefit from being around some clean musicians. With Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin rounding out the band, they played a few shows locally as the Gacy Bunch before decorum prevailed and they rebilled themselves as Mad Season. Even that band name is druggy: a term for the time of year when psilocybin mushrooms are in bloom. In 1995, Mad Season released their one and only album, Above, which notched an honest-to-God radio hit with “River of Deceit”-- something that higher-profile side projects Brad and Temple of the Dog never managed. Efforts to record a follow-up in 1997 went nowhere. Saunders OD’ed in ’99, Staley in ’02.18 years after its release, Above is getting the deluxe reissue treatment, complete with unreleased live tracks, a DVD, and some recently completed recordings from the aborted follow-up sessions. It’s a handsome package and easily the definitive statement on this Seattle footnote, but all those extras can’t compensate for what is a bewilderingly self-absorbed album, one so dully self-serious that in retrospect it may have killed grunge dead. So combative and caustic with Alice in Chains, Staley lets his ongoing self-examination curdle into clunky therapyspeak and ponderous nonsense. “My pain is self-chosen, at least I believe it to be,” he insists on “River of Deceit”, succinctly summing up everything that was wrong with 90s alt-rock.It’s not entirely Staley’s fault. Mad Season was a new group, and its members were still figuring out what all they could do together. In the reissue liner notes, Barrett Martin maintains they were actually a blues band, which isn’t quite as incredible as it might sound: Saunders, older than his bandmates by a decade, had spent long years in the Chicago and Minneapolis blues scenes, backing Hubert Sumlin and Lamont Cranston. Still, Mad Season wasn’t necessarily interested in blues structure or subject matter, at least not directly. Instead, these songs are long on vaguely bluesy atmosphere. In other words: ominous, minor key, crossroadsy. The average song length runs between six and seven minutes, which makes Above a real slog. They fill that time with some heavy riffage, some noodling straight off a “Yellow Ledbetter” outtake, some marimba chords, and a saxophone solo. It’s not blues grunge so much as lounge grunge.While Seattle is credited with stamping out the previous decade’s decadent hard rock, heavy metal was always a crucial influence on grunge. The band members’ day-job groups may have sounded like punk that had integrated classic rock at a molecular level, but on Above the nods to metals acts are obvious and unmistakable. Not one but two songs, including opener “Wake Up”, crib the subdued psych-murk of Black Sabbath’s “Planet Caravan”, and McCready does his best Jimmy Page on “name” and pretty much every other song. Led Zeppelin’s influence isn’t merely in his mile-high riffs, but in the relationship between the lead guitar and the rhythm section. The former struts, the latter stomps, but the effect is all too familiar. Mad Season weren’t interpreting these acts, but merely aping them.Still, the band’s try-anything ethos is commendable and even occasionally exciting. The glam-punk chorus of “I’m Above” makes good use of Staley’s potent sneer. Then the song breaks for a Spanish guitar solo, and the moment is so random that it becomes bracing, as though every possibility remains open to them. That’s what a side project is for, after all. But not once does Above sound like the work of a real side project-- like four guys relieved to be away from their workaday gigs. Despite the success of “River of Deceit” on alt-rock radio, Above was not especially well received in 1995, and Staley notes this fact on the live disc. He berates critics for writing “retarded reviews,” countering that the band had a “fucking blast” recording the album. Perhaps they did, but the music they made is anything but a blast. These songs are for the most part joyless and strained.Live, however, Mad Season sound more in their element. What seemed leaden in the studio comes off loose on the stage, as evidenced by recordings of their show at Seattle's Moore Theater on April 29, 1995, and footage from their New Year's Eve show later that year. Onstage, “name” becomes an especially punchy jam, anchored by the tremendous rhythm section, and local saxophone player Skerik vamps and skronks through John Lennon’s “I Don’t Wanna Be a Soldier” as the crowd moshes in slo-mo. The set lags towards the end and dies with a 14-minute version of “November Hotel”, but these guys actually look like they might be having fun up there. McCready even solos with the guitar behind his head. It’s goofy as shit, but that’s what makes it a highlight: it’s the one moment in the life of Mad Season when someone managed to crack a smile.\n",

            "As one of the most prolific artists in garage rock, Ty Segall faces a slightly uphill battle where his side bands' staying power is concerned. With eight strong solo albums and 20 collaborations released over the past eight years, the axeman’s discography is a genre stronghold, and a veritable wellspring for guitar nerds. But unless you’re a Segall stan, it can be tough to distinguish the IIs from the Twins, the Sleepers from the Slaughterhouses, the collaborations with White Fence or Mikal Cronin. So when Segall announced the formation of GØGGS–another side project, this time a trio with Ex-Cult’s Chris Shaw on lead vocals, Fuzz’s Charles Moothart on drums, and Segall on guitar–just months after dropping the enjoyable (if stylistically inert) Emotional Mugger, it was tough to muster the excitement for their self-titled debut, a 10-track punk record forged during post-tour jam sessions and intra-band sleepovers. Keeping up with Segall’s catalogue proves an exhausting task at times, but never a slog. He's yet to put out a bad record: a reputation forged by latent musical skill, staunch discipline, and in the case of GØGGS, explosive rapport. Shaw may be GØGGS’ lead singer and principal songwriter, but it’s Segall doing most of the heavy lifting. The Californian’s guitar playing and backing vocals supply most of the album’s melodic thrust. No showboating or exorbitant solos here; on Dead Kennedy-esque rippers like “GØGGS,” “Smoke the Würm,” and “Shotgun Shooter,” Segall sticks to choppy down-strums and feedback-fueled tantrums, grounded by Mootheart’s cymbal-heavy clatter–a far cry from his usual, heavy-lidded psych jams. A few reliable standby guests drop in: Wand’s Cory Hanson plays bass and synths on “album,” while Vial’s Denee Peetracek lends vocals to “name.” Cronin lays down some grooves on “Glendale Junkard,” too, because what would a Ty Segall production be without him?The album’s reliance on tinnitus-inducing sound effects and threadbare production styles safely situate it within Segall’s canon (Lead single “She Got Harder” streamlines the sludgy palette showcased on Twins, while “Assassinate the Doctor” reprises Emotional Mugger’s smothering noise-rock), but Shaw’s atonal, shouted vocals (a product of his hardcore upbringing) and violent lyrics (“I’m creeping through the night/with blood in mind”; “Double barrel in the dark/And I always hit my mark”) cast Ex-Cult’s distinctive paranoid pall over the proceedings. Having honed his skills in Memphis’ hardcore scene, the southerner possesses the sheer power and technical prowess needed to reign in his bandmates’ chaos: most noticeably on “name,” where Shaw (backed by Peetracek) brandishes a single, clipped phrase–machete-like, slashing through a blaring, glitchy soundscape. (Ironically enough, his screeched, nihilistic statement comprises the listener’s only foothold in the nightmarish whorl.)Segall, Shaw, and Moothart never set out to shift paradigms or start a revolution– they’re simply three friends, hellbent on sustaining guitar music’s urgency and simplicity. In the age of glossy mixing and instrumental auto-pilot, their ungovernable racket’s refreshing and woefully needed, and judging from Shaw’s remarks in the album’s press release, the band recognize the power of such escapism. “This is not a side project,” he said of the band, “it is a necessity.” Judging from the sounds of this album, they don’t take that responsibility lightly–and it shows.\n",
            "It's impressive what Russian Circles can do with a basic guitar, bass, and drum setup. There are plenty of metal-leaning instrumental bands who dial up big climaxes, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one that creates such an array of textures and emotions with so little. Bassist Brian Cook also uses keyboards, and on the Chicago trio's excellent fifth album, album, they bring in guest cello and violin. But the core, buttressed by imaginative arrangements and strong compositional skills, is strong enough that there would be more than enough chills without these add-ons.The collection follows 2011's Empros. That was a strong effort, too; the eight tracks here, though, feel more polished and fluid, bigger and yet somehow more intimate—even though the pristine recording, again by longtime producer Brandon Curtis, also fits well with the vast, mountainous cover art. Empros had a swing to it, a groove that bled between tracks even when they got darker or heavier. album offers more pronounced dynamics in both directions—the metal moments frenzied, the quiet parts somber and restrained—and instead of offering a push or pull, it goes for higher star-melting theatrics. In that regard, you'd have to place them in the company of Explosions in the Sky, another band that can create compelling narratives without words.Russian Circles do seem to be telling a story here. The clean guitars and strings on brief opener \"Memoriam\" make it feel like a eulogy, and the remaining songs offer the various emotions that come with loss (anger, panic, nostalgia, pain). \"Memoriam\" is an airy piece that jarringly shifts into the heavy, lurching \"name\", an almost seven-minute track that, like \"Mladek\" on Empros, shows you that they have no trouble breaking into a black metal blur. They conjure the Fucking Champs and go explosion-for-explosion with the aforementioned post-rock titans.It's followed by the longest and best song on the album, the seven-and-a-half minute \"1777\". This piece opens with loud, crisp drums that are reminiscent of early Tortoise—John McEntire locking into a groove for a snare-drunk 20 minutes. Cascading guitars and a steady bass circle it, adding a sense of flight to the grounded beats. The dynamics here are reminiscent of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, who also balance darkness and muck with a sense of the sublime. The slow-motion crescendo at the five-and-a-half-minute mark, the additional layers of spiraling guitars, and chaotically controlled drums could build for another hour and not get boring.You don't get anything that great on the rest of the album; that said, it's an emotional peak you only need to reach once on a collection like this, and the restraint on the following tracks helps with the overall thematic. For instance, the somber, melancholic \"Cheyenne\" is a doomier, more spacious and cinematic song, like 2013 Earth collaborating with Mogwai. The mathy \"Burial\" is heavier, angrier, and complete with pick slides. This may be the album's real climax, at least mentally—during it, you're thinking about the suffocation in death, and not the release. It feeds into the romantic, ethereal \"Ethel\" and the rocker, \"Lebaron\". On album, the more they move away from the straight-up rock moments and into more ambitious constructions, the stronger it feels.The collection closes with vocals from labelmate Chelsea Wolfe on \"album\". It's a chilly, pretty piece that, like the opener, adds a softness to the record, along with a sonic and thematic echo. Wolfe, whispering and layered, sounds great per usual, but her vocal turn confirms something important: Unlike a bunch of bands who opt to go it without a singer, these guys really don't need one.\n",
            "I can think of no record in recent memory that illustrates the dubiousness of hyper-catchiness as much as the debut LP from album. Initially, the five piece's hook-laden record, which lyrically tackles hard-hitting issues such as bubble-blowing, rollerskating, colors, and stars with eyes, didn't appeal. It was so cheerful and sunny that I feared my eyes might start bleeding. After a few more listens, though, that potential blood turned to the joyous tears that can only result from being charmed by the social awareness of five-year-olds. \"Rad,\" I said during an umpteenth listen, between jubilant sobs. \"I'm fascinated by its love.\" Fast-forward to now, one week later. I haven't had the chance during the past seven days to revisit these adorable tykes. But you know, I don't really miss them. Sure, I'll hum a melody on occasion, or have a giggle over a lyric or two, but the impulse to actually listen to the record again never resurfaces. Why? Let's just say top 40 radio does it better, and without the adult-proof CandyLand gimmickry. But I suppose this sort of reaction is inevitable when the nature of album's music is taken into consideration. The band has already been likened to the Mamas and the Papas, and the Archies; both are fair enough reference points, though I don't recall any white-funk basslines burbling under \"Dedicated to the One I Love.\" \"Nightflight,\" for example, plays like a suburban take on Jean Knight's \"Mr Big Stuff,\" complete with throwaway lyrics like, \"Then I knew/ It was you/ Who had a different point of view/ And I paid no mind/ To the soul I lost inside.\" The song is as trite, non-specific, and meaningless as anything at the top of the Billboard singles chart. The remaining material is true to the form of \"Nightflight.\" The record's opener, \"Blowin' Bubbles,\" is a lite groove that sports male/female vocals singing, \"I'm drinkin' stars up in the sky/ You know who you are/ I'm drivin' cars around your house/ It seems so far.\" Meanwhile, the chorus of \"Rollerskate\" bestows wisdom like, \"Before you learn how to walk/ Before you learn how to walk/ You learn to rollerskate/ Hey.\" album would have me convinced that they're just trying to be cute and ironic with lines like this if it weren't for the impossibly straightforward vocal and musical delivery. Songs that could be prime examples of well-realized nonsense, a la Ween or \"Sifl and Olly,\" simply are not. This makes for an album that's lean, unobtrusive, and largely slight. The songs may be infectious, but this isn't as much a product of fine songwriting as an exercise in smart calculation. I'd be an elitist liar if I said that catchy, nothing pop songs don't have the tendency to make me swoon. Still, however strong an immediate visceral reaction may be, awareness of pending expiration is essential. album are a brief flash of enjoyable fluff. And that may be the band's very aim; to create utterly disposable, formulaic echoes of yesteryear's pop hits. Even so, we've already been taught this lesson countless times, and it's even more resounding when delivered with sincerity. Really! When Andy Gibb proclaimed, \"I just want to be your everything,\" millions of girls around the world were instantly wooed, praying that his piercing wails were unleashed for them alone. So, album can wax reminiscent all they want, but their unknown status-- in the indie world and otherwise-- suggests that nostalgia will never be on their side.\n",
            "It's only fair to cut film scores some slack and judge them as non-canonical diversions. They're dependent on missing imagery, and often released mainly as advertisements for the films. But when a beloved band's name is on the cover, we can't help but feel as if we're being promised a little more-- that the release has an aesthetic motivation beyond the promotional. If Hans-Christian Schmid's film, album, has fans, then perhaps this score will be useful to them. But it will do little for any but the most adoringly blinkered Notwist fans. It's so thin and generic that selling it as a Notwist record feels faintly deceitful, as it could be by anybody, for any moody indie film.Brevity is great when it's focused around moving themes or a sense of development, but the microtonal squalls and static melodies the Notwist work in here need more time to sink in, and are unproductive when portioned out over 11 tracks in under half an hour. Perhaps they suit the film wonderfully. This is the Notwist's second collaboration with Schmid, so something must click there. But out of context, it just sounds like they gathered up all the usual haunting-soundtrack materials around them-- glockenspiels and bowed xylophones, minimal pianos and strings, pressurized electronic loops-- and failed to do anything with them except idle in a low gear. Certainly nothing offends the ear, barring perhaps the shrill ridges of tone that compose the entirety of \"Simon\". But the score comes to its quick conclusion with a distinct sense of, \"That's it?\"There's something bloodless about these pieces that dulls the impact of even time-proven soundtrack tricks. The stiff two-note piano figure on \"Vilna Kosa Version\" (featuring the Andromeda Mega Express Orchestra) gestures toward unease without actually producing any, like a blank-faced actor holding a sign that says \"anxious.\" The sonar pulse of \"The Hague\" eventually snaps into a canned trip-hop beat with grim inevitability. Flashes of potency-- the delicately tactile polyrhythms of \"Sarajevo 1\" and \"2\", and the restrained martial peals of \"album 1\"-- are just that, flashes. It's not bad music, mostly, but it's just like all the interstitial parts of a Notwist record knitted together, without any of their terrific songcraft to sustain them. Assuming that you have a limited record-buying budget (a fanciful notion that, presumably, bands selling albums nevertheless endorse), it's the definition of inessential.\n",
            "Here's the conclusion from my review of the Pale Young Gentlemen's 2007 self-released debut: \"while Pale Young Gentlemen is frontloaded and slightly naïve...there's more than enough reason to anticipate what they're capable of when they decide to get darker, older, and less gentle.\" I love it when bands make it easy for me: Though the concept of \"growth\" can border on illusory, the shady, gnarled Black Forest comes on less strong than Pale Young Gentlemen, but is ultimately a lot harder to shake than its charming, if slightly hammy predecessor. Similar to fellow Wisconsinites Violet Femmes, PYG essentially render a normally bombastic framework in acoustic terms: For the former, it was punk; for the latter, it's orchestral pop. \"We could talk for hours/ Or maybe not at all\" doesn't read like much of a mission statement, but sunk within album centerpiece \"Kettle Drum (I Left a Note)\", it's indicative of a band learning to leave more to the imagination. Despite massive turnover amidst its ranks and less than a year removed from Pale Young Gentlemen, what distinguishes Black Forest is the patience of confident survivors, not just of their first tour, but the easy comparisons to more maudlin and forthright old world-influenced acts like Beirut.   And it's tough record to initially get a hold of with all of its novel textures-- like their self-titled, Black Forest begins with a stuttering acoustic riff suggesting hip-hop as much as folk, but \"Coal/Ivory\" morphs into something more expansive and majestic, replete with the keenest coal lyric this side of \"Oxford Comma\".  Nearly every track is built off a new string instrument, from the stumbling, thumbed arpeggios that give \"I Wasn't Worried\" a subtle charm to the washed-out harp of \"We Will Meet\" to the pizzicato, agreeably bumbling chorus of \"Wedding Guest\". Throughout, Michael Reisenauer's maundering vocals holds the disparate arrangements together like putty, though his lyrics are just shy of scrutability for the most part, overcast invocations of women and wine. The light touch might still be a turnoff to some, since they're occasionally boxed in by their commitment to a sort of pop music that more archaic than Arcade-ish. \"The Crook of My Good Arm\" is the most obvious \"rock\" moment, with a vigorous tempo and a cello riff simulating the bass-- a trick also used by A.C. Newman. More surprising is how the violin jabs of \"Our History\" recall \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and its martial stridency: Reisenauer's cry \"I was like a child/ You can't touch me!\" is more of a well-earned moment of release than a cheap joke. Which is not to call these guys prudes-- it's a testament to their mastery of subtle suggestion that a line like \"Bodies twist and hips crash/ Kissing thighs in between\" can blend in without triggering a gag reflex.\n",
            "Were it not for the clarity of the recording, you would be hard-pressed to guess that Chatham County Line's sophomore album, album, was recorded this century, or even in the past 40 years. The album was recorded with the four members huddled around a microphone, harmonizing and plucking mandolins, banjos and guitars, and you can practically hear the dimensions of the room they're standing in. This is straight bluegrass without a hyphen or a prefix-- it has nothing to do with pastiche, a pose, or modern country music. From first note to last, it's obvious these guys have done ample homework. There's something refreshing about listening to an album recorded by guys who aren't afraid to unironically embellish an ending with a little \"yo-del-ay-hee\" or write simple, straightforward ballads that tell real stories with no gimmicks. Dave Wilson's lyrics are gloriously unpretentious as he takes the role of an inmate wondering aloud whether his wife will still be there when he gets out of prison on \"Arms of the Law\" or inhabits a hobo searching for warmth in the winter on \"Nowhere to Sleep\". They pale in comparison to the stunning title track, however, which tells the story of his father's business, a service station on album whose business all but dies when the state builds a new superhighway miles away-- apparently, Wilson's own father actually ran a hardware store that suffered a similar fate. What's truly striking about the way the story unfolds, though, is the lack of bitterness as Wilson refuses to cry over spilled milk. Of course, it helps that the music is like some sort of majestic time machine. Wilson's voice is strong but not overbearing, weaving memorable melodies into his narratives, and the playing is expert but never sterile or clichd-- on \"Saro Jane\" they even let the music unfold into a sort of organic soundscape with shuddering mandolin and hovering fiddle. The two instrumentals, fiddler/mandolinist John Teer's \"Gunfight in Durango\" and banjoist Chandler Holt's \"Sun Up\", are pumping two-step throw-downs, each bursting with wild banjo, fiddle, and mandolin. The harmonies are like a little slice of back-porch heaven: \"Louisiana Freight Train\" has the best, rich, swaying stacks of voices topped by guest Caitlin Cary that roll around the chords like clouds over the plains. There a few songs that don't quite have the momentum of the album's best material, but for a new band writing starkly traditional bluegrass (they only play one cover on the whole album), this is shockingly strong material, occasional hiccups aside. Obviously, if you're not into old mountain music, there's nothing on here for you, but if you enjoy bluegrass, dig in. The highlights here are as good as it gets.\n",
            "Why is this valedictorian crying? For the classmates he's leaving behind? For that van full of kids who drove drunk into the storm ditch after prom? No, if the speaker is Carey Mercer, who fronts Victoria, B.C.'s Frog Eyes, he's bawling because he's supposed to be an adult now and what's more a man, but there are no men around, only military blowhards, craven merchants, and drunken dads. Frog Eyes have been a band more namechecked than listened to, thanks to now-and-then keyboardist Spencer Krug's other groups (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown), and Mercer's collaboration last year with Krug and Dan Bejar of Destroyer under the guise of Swan Lake. While Mercer shares his friends' elliptical and bombastic rhetoric, he's at once more of an orator and more of a synesthesist, working with smears and splatters more than melodies, and bringing his own fixations. Tears of the Valedictorian is Frog Eyes' first substantial advance since 2003's The Golden River, which was a fanciful songcycle on a backdrop of ecological anxiety. The Folded Palm (2004) approximated the frenzy of their shows, but at the expense of the songs. The intervening mini-albums were pleasant small-scale studies. Valedictorian again mobilizes the band's full palette-- Mercer's wife Melanie Campbell's stomping drums and flat stutter cymbals, Krug's keyboards switching from crosshatch shadows to radiant showers, Michael Rak's grounding bass, Mercer's and McCloud Zicmuse's light-seeking insect guitars and, always, Mercer's gibbering, his croon, his grumbles, his yodeling yip. Mercer stands in the lineage of rock frontman as half-carnival-barker, half-gnostic-preacher that Greil Marcus describes as the \"crank prophet,\" from Screamin' Jay Hawkins through Arthur Lee of Love, Captain Beefheart, David Thomas of Pere Ubu, Tom Waits, and the Pixies' Frank Black. But Frog Eyes' sound owes more to early Roxy Music-- music that filtered out blues in favor of high modernism-- as well as advertising jingles and John Philip Sousa. In keeping with Victoria's Brit-dominated demographics, it also recalls English music hall, though the hall is on a riverboat and the river on fire. Mercer's preoccupation here seems to be masculinity, as it often has been in rock, the music of boys coming of age. But unlike Mick Jagger or Bruce Springsteen (whose trace, as so often these days, shows up here in some surprising runs of piano fills and exhortations), Mercer is stalking the heath of manhood's ruination. He turns over artifacts of Romanticism like an anthropologist on a dig, sketching out the landscape and puzzling over how these dick-swinging ancients survived. His yowls are the cry of somebody waking up from history with a hangover-- \"he was what the Poor call the Maimed,\" he sings-- as its dreams disperse over the horizon of legibility. I don't mean to make Mercer sound like a nostalgist. His voice is nothing if not urgently present, struggling to pull his warring selves into some workable here and now. He invokes patriarchs just to dispose of them, from the \"Roman ambassador\" who is \"torn apart by plaster and reassembled after\" in the opener, \"Idle Songs,\" to the \"druken and besotted father figure\" who's pushed out to sea on an ice floe in \"Evil Energy, the Ill Twin of...\" They stand between Mercer and a longed-for future in which the masculine spirit somehow gets sane and whole. Meanwhile, touchingly, that bad dad out on the ice \"trembles and he trembles and he puts his heart on tremble.\" Mercer breaks from the crank-prophet line in that he wants to defeat his solipsism, to hack his way out of the thicket of male ghosts and build relationships-- with nature, lovers, family, his band and the listener. This album is peppered with references to himself as singer, from the epic second track \"Caravan Breakers, They Prey on the Weak and the Old\" (\"I bet you are sick of hearing songs about the trail\") to the entrancing near-closer \"Bushels\", which assures \"there's a colony in song\" and ends on the simple statement, \"I was a singer and I sang in your home.\" In between comes \"The Policy Merchant, the Silver Bay\", an acoustic, falsetto-sung ballad in which he teases, \"Mercer is a merchant, a policy merchant/ He calls himself urgent!/ He gathers all of the urchins up in their tearaways/ He gathers them into his palm and then he sings 'Another Day.'\" These wry acknowledgments feel especially gracious from a singer who is so under siege by sound and by the unending, unpredictable demands of all the voices of past and future birthing and dying in his gullet. But that's what Frog Eyes achieves here, not just in the songwriting but in the band's new dynamic range and precision-- for the first time, there's space in their hermetic universe for the rest of us. It's graduation day.\n",
            "\"The Secret Chiefs are the invisible conductors of the initiation of the world, and the secret regulators of all human experience on earth. The Secret Chiefs influence us all, either directly or indirectly, through their representatives on earth, who are parts of the all and of the Great Movement of Things.\"        --David Cherubim, The Golden Dawn and the Secret Chiefs Nothing is true, everything is permitted.        --Hassan-i-Sabbah Legend has it that 11th Century Persian sheikh Hassan-i-Sabbah inspired fanatic, even suicidal, devotion from his legions. His method of initiation was to kidnap and drug his foes' fiercest soldiers, then bring them to his fully functioning Garden of Earthly Delights, which was complete with exotic delicacies, fountains of wine, and good-to-go virgins. When his captives came to, dazed and suggestible in their psychedelic stupors, they were told they had died and entered heaven. Sabbah had only to promise that each of his subjects would return to Paradise if fortunate enough to martyr himself in his service. For a century, Sabbah's Hashishim-- \"Hash Eaters,\" from which we derive the word assassin-- were the most feared killers in the known world. It seems that Sabbah and Trey Spruance have something in common. Spruance, Secret Chiefs 3's chief composer and a former guitarist for Mr. Bungle, is a visionary madman capable of instilling both fear and respect in his listeners. Secret Chiefs 3 have existed in various incarnations over the course of the past eight years, and have served as the funnel for Spruance's remarkably far-flung studies of the hermetic mysteries and musical traditions of unknown and underappreciated subgenres. Album titles like Grand Constitution and Bylaws and Book M hint at the music's vaguely metaphysical bent. Over three years in the making, album is Secret Chiefs' most expansive and coherent statement, an alchemical fusion of Morricone-esque cinematic grandeur, midnight surf guitar, traditional Middle Eastern rhythms and time signatures, demonic death metal, and electronic deviance that yields a work of undeniable force. The album seems to develop a more acute, galloping schizophrenia as it progresses. The opening quartet of tunes-- each attributed to a different sub-group of Chiefs-- moves from solemn to wanton: \"The End Times\", with plaintive bowed saw and string section, moves to the black-market Bollywood funk of \"The 4\" by Ishraqiyun, which, after a brief, eerie dub interlude, bleeds into to the brutal screamfest \"Exterminating Angel\" by the Holy Vehm. Though the variance is great between the songs, each stays within the format of its genre. That respect to structure unravels quickly and intoxicatingly in the album's midsection. As the cast of players rotates, so do the names of the ensembles-- a narrative touch that lends album an epic feel. Common threads like copious strings and exotic percussion provided by William Winant (Thurston Moore's go-to skins man), Shazad Ismaily (Brian Eno, Elysian Fields), and Phil Franklin (Sunburned Hand of the Man) maintain some semblance of order. By the time \"The Owl in Daylight\" appears-- sweeping from creepy electro grind to soothing acoustic guitar and chimes-- and the hallucinatory beachfront kasbah groove of \"On the Wings of Haoma\" by The Electromagnetic Azoth takes flight, unpredictability has taken the reins. Potentially the album's pivot point, UR's \"Book T: Exodus\" is a remake of the Exodus movie theme, incorporating immense string and horn ensembles created purely through meticulous overdubs. It's a gorgeously orchestrated moment that wouldn't be out of place in the closing credits of a 1970s Godzilla flick. As the album nears its close, two of the final pieces move through so many styles that trying to peg them all would be impossible. The titles speak for themselves: \"DJ Revisionist (The Spin Masta, Kultur Killa, with da Mad Crypto-Colonial Skillz)\" and \"Anthropomorphosis: Boxleitner\" are exercises in new wave Middle Eastern electro freak lullaby majesty. This is the kind of music that really must be heard to be understood, bound by a surreal logic both ridiculous and unforced; a true accomplishment, indeed. Whether or not Spruance and his Secret Chiefs 3 are the intermediaries between heaven and earth is, um, hard to say, but with album it seems they're certainly communing with a power beyond the merely human. Virtuosity, paired with a fearless love of divergent styles and the humor and talent to skillfully, unmercifully mash them up, pushes this album into rarified heights. Bungle's major label connections and early association with John Zorn have given them a mainstream exposure that Secret Chiefs 3 will probably never receive. But Spruance's mongoloid baby is a golden child, effortlessly balancing aplomb, apocalypse and apoplexy to create a truly daring, mystifying journey.\n",
            "\"Ah, another Sea and Cake record,\" you might think. Which sounds dismissive yet is comforting-- the Sea and Cake are the definition of consistent and singular: They don't sound like anyone else, they're too smart and careful to make a truly bad record, and they're comfortable with existing range of possibilities of the project. So a new Sea and Cake album means you know what you are getting. This is their eighth full-length, and it follows just a year and a half after Everybody, so maybe some people haven't had a chance yet to miss the band. A lot more time separated each of the prior three (The Fawn in 1997, Oui in 2000, and One Bedroom in 2003), after all. Another Sea and Cake record, so soon?But those who followed the band in its early days will recall that the Sea and Cake released their first three albums in just over a year, a run that, looking back, was one of those rare examples of a truly original band overflowing with creativity. Beginning as yet another side project in a Chicago scene that seemed like nothing but-- often great but relatively lesser bands like Shrimp Boat, the Coctails, and (sorry) Tortoise were among their antecedents-- the Sea and Cake were the ideal sorta-pop face of post-rock, as challenging and complex as their peers but a hell of a lot more listenable. Their self-tilted debut, Nassau, and The Biz-- the three records in that first early run-- are stuffed with fantastic songs and brimming with energy. During a decade obsessed with fusion, constantly looking for ways to integrate previously obscure music of the past into something new and fresh, the Sea and Cake hit a vein where the bright guitars of West Africa and the skittering samba of Brazil could mix with jazz, soul, calypso, and more under the umbrella of indie rock. With so much thrown into the pot, the early Sea and Cake enjoyed a flexibility that allowed them to create songs at will, and during that stretch songs like \"Jacking the Ball\", \"The Biz\", and \"Parasol\" sounded both surprising and strangely inevitable.In 1997, the Sea and Cake released The Fawn, a smoother, slicker, and more muted album than its predecessors, and also one that leaned heavily toward electronics. Its sound and approach guided the band during the quiet period of the next ten years, during which they would release the two records that, while still good (there's that consistency again), stand now as their weakest. The problem with Oui and One Bedroom is hard to define since \"coasting\" isn't really a pejorative with this band; their M.O. is such that you want them to coast a little, to float along unencumbered by friction. Still, last year's Everybody showed what was missing from those records, serving as a reminder that melodic invention, a bit more drive, and quirky hooks had central roles on the best Sea and Cake albums. And all those qualities are present on album to an even greater degree, making this their best album in over a decade.The album is called album and song titles allude to things like \"Weekend\", \"Window Sills\", and \"Down in the City\", all of which could conceivably be combined to sketch out the album's themes, maybe something about modern urban life and escape or something. But that's not the way that singer Sam Prekop's lyrics work. Words seem chosen for their musical qualities first, and there's faith that a stream of unconnected phrases will for each listener add up to something personal that makes sense. And it does indeed work out that way. The mood of the songs isn't driven by content of the words, but by the overall feel, the way the production and arrangements and melodious turns of phrase combine to create pictures in your head.So the chiming acoustic guitars of \"Weekend\", rubbing up against the bright, chirpy keyboard sequence, all pivoting around the careful wobble of Eric Claridge's bass, evokes a brisk pan across a frenetic streetscape. The easy up-tempo chug of \"On a Letter\", with the drums and bass curling around each other for warmth, a guitar break with the relaxed gregariousness of a Jerry Garcia solo, and Sam Prekop jumping up a half-octave to his whispery upper register for emphasis, makes you think, say, of those moments when you feel just on the cusp of something great and are ready to make your move. The uptempo and spacious \"A Fuller Moon\", with its hints of steel drum and bubbly beat, is a great reminder of how effective the Sea and Cake can be when they put together a tune you can easily hum. \"Keep on holding on,\" Prekop sings, but there's never too much at stake in a Sea and Cake song, and that's the way it should be. Theirs is a contemplative sort of music, unapologetically cerebral even as it provides its share of physical pleasures.The sound throughout-- as ever recorded and mixed by drummer John McEntire-- is gorgeous, and a nice reminder of how thoughtful simplicity can still carry a lot of weight. The guitar tone during the brief solo on \"New Schools\", brushed with the kind of glowing distortion that can only come from a vintage amp that's endured a long life in our debased world, is breathtaking, and other subtle touches abound. The minute-long synth pulse of \"CMS Sequence\" that follows \"On a Letter\" reinforces the album's commitment to flow, as its 12 songs in 38 minutes are laid together just so. The trend continues with the closing \"Mirrors\", an abstract but pretty 98-second steel drum instrumental finds the album-- another Sea and Cake record, yes, but one even completists will continue to reach for-- slipping quietly out the door when no one is looking.\n",
            "Boxcutter knows his shit. At least that's the impression he leaves listening to album: a man who's studied the past 20 years of electronic music with a historian's eye for exacting detail, if not exactly an innovator's need to prod unexpected pleasure centers. The rhythmic choices, springing from Boxcutter's previous work, make this music dubstep, at least nominally. But very little about the album otherwise points to any of the London bass-centric subgenre's current stylsitic conceits, save perhaps a sonic palette that tends toward the days of repurposed Atari 2600 SFX set to a beat. album reflects a longer and stronger lineage, one that starts well before FWD>> opened its doors or South Londoners began siphoning the estrogen from two-step.And so for the most part we get a mash note, in the form of non-referential homage, to the housebound geniuses who left their rainbow-tinted fingerprints all over white label buyers' expectations in a post-acid world. The boogie b-line and retro-brittle handclaps on \"S p a c e b a s s\" are the breakdance-friendly roots of all those hip-hop import fiends whose spastic enthusiasm for shuddering synthetic beats would have them dubbed \"I.D.M.\" a few years later. Likewise, \"Free House Acid\" is yet another attempt to make overlapping quasi-acidic bleeps harmonize like dueling opera singers in a Chuck Jones cartoon. And for every fleet slice of dark, swinging neo-garage (like \"Mya Rave v2\"), there's something like the title track, which splits the difference between the stiff-limbed early days of Warp Records and the label's convoluted second wave, rigid LFO suddenly nipped and tucked a thousand times over into something closer to Autechre.Two things keep Boxcutter's latest from the tedium of unchecked nostalgia for sounds which never left us long enough to be missed. One, the garage-ish tempos mean all that acidic filigree never gets overbearing the way it can when combined with the \"look ma, no brakes\" programming that's the bane of Boxcutter's post-drill'n'bass peers. And two, he's wedded to neither the sound of 1989 or 1999; curveballs like the slanted J Dilla funk of \"A Cosmic Parent\" keep album from simply being a experiment in bleeding one rave era into another. Still, most of the album is throwback enough to be a pleasant one-off, not so much a work of fevered straining at a genre's edges so much as a well-crafted nod to the O.G.'s of Brit bleeping, made with grace and a smile. And if you've been lamenting a lack of hairy electro-tinged riffage in your life, here's a quick re-up.\n",
            "Imagine there's nothing funny about the 1980s. Block out your referential nostalgia, your tendency to make punchlines out of Cazals and keytars. Unlearn everything you know about Stock-Aitken-Waterman and gated drums and the synthesizers in \"The Final Countdown\". Try to think about how the music of the era might've sounded to you if you were experiencing it for the first time, without any knowledge of where or when it was made.Now you're ready to listen to Dâm-Funk. One of Stones Throw's recent breakthrough stars, L.A.'s Damon Riddick spent the 90s as a session keyboardist for assorted New Jack Swing and hip-hop acts (most prominently on the soundtrack to Master P's I Got the Hook-Up), and lately has parlayed his love for music into a popular 80s boogie/funk DJ night, Funkmosphere, at the Venice Boulevard club Carbon. His recent work reflects a confluence of these two bullet points on his résumé, as he jumps from retro-novel intrigue (2008's \"Burgundy City\" b/w \"Galactic Fun\") to indie-crossover remix buzz (his incredible transformation of Animal Collective's \"Summertime Clothes\") to the ambitious sprawl of a five-part debut album series, intended as a mission statement for what he calls \"modern funk.\"That series has been pared down to the 2xCD, 140-minute collection album, which shares the name of the collection from which it draws. It's your call how best to experience this stuff; each individual volume of the original album series has its own thematic undercurrent (\"Hood\", \"Life\", \"Sky\", etc.) and its own strengths, but this condensed aggregation pares it down to a manageable, cohesive 24-track introduction at the cost of editing down a couple of the songs. Either way, you've got a thorough rundown of Dâm-Funk's repertoire this year, which, even in its pared-down form, is an absurdly prolific output-- apparently it would've come out sooner, but the man couldn't stop recording new tracks for it.Anyone with a thing for g-funk should find instant geek-out recognition in this music, a garage-bound DIY love letter to the post-Worrell musical diaspora that covers everything from Roger Troutman's eternal bounce to the cosmic jazz crossover of the Clarke/Duke Project. In between, you get slow-ride R&B jams (\"One Less Day\"; \"I Wanna Thank You For [Steppin Into My Life]\"), grooves that toy with the more prog- and fusion-influenced corners of funk (\"Flying V Ride\"), post-disco dance music (\"Candy Dancin'\"), proto-electro (\"Keep Lookin' 2 the Sky\"), and just about anything else you might've heard on the SOLAR label 25 years ago. There are nods to the retrofitting treatment that the cream of late-70s/early-80s Moog funk underwent once DJ Quik and Dr. Dre got ahold of it; \"Killdat aka Killdatmuthafu*ka\" actually sounds a bit more like 1992 than 1983, all sinister chords and bop-gun percussion.But calling Dâm-Funk's music straight-up throwback nostalgia only skirts what's really appealing about it. For the first minute or so, you might dredge up some roller-rink memories, but once that groove sets in-- granite-thick Moog bass coupled with drum machine breaks so propulsive their physical impetus overrides their mechanicalness-- it starts transcending historical allusions and becomes all about structure and groove, about how just plain fucking great fat Roland basslines and Oberheim kick drums sound together. That's about when you get waylaid by one of Riddick's solos-- fluttering and unpredictable, often flowing more like something that might come out of a free jazz sax or an acid rock guitar than a funk synthesizer. It's the secret weapon that underscores how seriously he takes this stuff, the catalyst that should provoke listeners to realize this music isn't just a fun update of a classic sound-- it's a work of real transcendence.This isn't a comedic tribute to talkboxes and widebrims; there's no Snoop Dogg descending a foggy staircase through a faded VHS haze here. album is a deep, astute collection that feels like a natural resuscitation and progression of funk as it stood just before hip hop usurped it. Much in the same way that Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings transform from a reenactment of a circa '66 soul revue to a distinct set of musical personalities the more you listen to them, Dâm-Funk uses all his vintage equipment as a medium to express his own voice, tucking a lot of stealthy forward progress and experimental tendencies between the notes. Chortle at that keytar all you want-- he can still make it sound like the future.\n",
            "Pop music takes a lot of shit from the uninformed; for whatever reason, it's a perpetually misunderstood venture. Last week, the New Yorker opted to define the genre as a \"sweet, beguiling, never-too-challenging sound which has been a record industry staple from Bing Crosby to Doris Day to Britney Spears.\" While it's smart to classify pop in terms that stretch beyond cleared capital and chart placement, doesn't it also seem myopic to handcuff pop to dopey facility? It might be bully-fun to call pop naive, but most good pop songs are complex enough to turn banal, everyday suffering into something far more palatable: properly conjured, a pop song is more than capable of translating gnarled, sloppy passions into big, swelling choruses and sticky hooks, making the otherwise intangible pings of being stupid and human not only real, but shiny and pleasant, too. Behind every successful pop song there's a solid reason to sob; that it actually makes you grin is pop's crucial creative triumph. Which is more genius than \"sweet.\" So calling the Pernice Brothers a pop project isn't the same as economic prophesizing or patronizing their mission. It's fairly unlikely that Yours Mine & Ours, the Brothers' latest record (self-released on Pernice's own Ashmont label, with, presumably, a modest marketing push) will ever crack mainstream markets, however suitable its calm, soothing melodies might be to blithe summertime cruising (check the 4th of July fireworks on the cover and gnaw a leftover hot dog, Americans). It's equally unlikely that anyone would find this record \"never-too-challenging.\" But Yours Mine & Ours is driven by the same kind of quirky pop sensibility you'd find in a Top 40 song-- the incessant juxtaposition of reality and fantasy, of rolling heartbreaks up in unbearably light, lush harmonies and amiably cooed bits of poetry. For the most part, the album is straightforward, guitar-driven stuff; nobody crams a fork into the mixer, vintage synthesizers don't disintegrate mid-bridge in a flurry of swooning blips, and Pernice's lyrics almost always make some sort of narrative sense, produced with an unapologetic eye toward polished melodies and clean, sweet finishes. Unlike the Pernice Brothers' previous two records, which featured loads of gushing strings and some big orchestral bombast, this is also a solid rock effort-- guitars, drums, bass, occasional piano or keyboard, and flawlessly harmonized vocals, exclusively. Taking a cue from his pitch- perfect vocals, Pernice has imbued Yours Mine & Ours with a golden glow reminiscent of classic AM radio and mid-60s Brian Wilson: it's all sunshine and broken hearts. \"Baby in Two\" could sit comfortably on any Elliott Smith album, with its rich acoustic strums and steady percussion, a honey-voiced Joe backing himself in half-whispered laments: \"I wish I knew/ A sure, simple way to reach you/ I'd be the King if I could say to you/ Cut the baby in two.\" Pernice's oddly dark (and inarguably bizarre) couplet (dig your own interpretation) eventually shifts into a high, rousing chorus of \"Cut the baby in two!\"; \"Baby in Two\" is probably the most pointed example of the Pernice Brothers sneaking an explicitly distressing plea into a sunny, eyes-closed acoustic sigh (this kind of age-old pop mischief is all over Yours Mine & Ours-- \"Number Two\" cheerily admits \"I hope that this letter finds you crying/ Feels so good to see you cry.\") Opener \"The Weakest Shade of Blue\" is an impeccably composed, perpetually sparkling string of singalong pop hooks that clocks in at a perfect three minutes; \"Water Ban\" is lilting and strangely addictive, a pastoral rumination on summertime drought (think crispy front lawns, brown patches, and dull, hollow swimming pools: \"It's hard to understand/ The cruel, cruel summer of a water ban\") evoked via rolling guitar and twinkling keyboards. \"Sometimes I Remember\" is a Cure tribute via New Order, marked by a curious stream of backing falsettos and thick, post-punk guitar. Overall, Yours Mine & Ours is strikingly consistent: each track is fully realized, thoughtfully written, and prudently performed, rolled out with a steadiness that can become a little maddening after a handful of listens. But like any successful pop venture, the album can feel a bit formulaic (and, occasionally, laboriously nostalgic): what ultimately saves this record from redundancy is Joe Pernice's stuttering conviction that every word he sings has been dunked in some kind of big, bold truth. Even those who prefer their pop records scrappier or more aggressively innovative should be able to unearth some kind of slack-jawed, clench-your-fist glee here; instantly impressed or not, it's almost impossible not to eventually uncover something useful in Pernice's intense, earnest dirge. 2003 has already seen pop principles well showcased by commercially peripheral bands like the New Pornographers and the Lilys (incidentally, Pernice Brothers bassist Thom Monahan played bass on two Lilys records), who twist pop formula into something smart and occasionally perverse. On Yours Mine & Ours, the Pernice Brothers have done same. Pop music edges one step closer to justice.\n",
            "Twenty years ago, James McNew was still the new guy in Yo La Tengo, hand-coloring the covers of 7-inch singles seemed like a totally reasonable thing to do, and tape hiss was more than a badge of pride-- it was a sign of membership to an international society of home-recording introverts who all listened to each other. That was the environment into which the first two solo albums McNew made under the name Dump emerged, timidly and elegantly. They're modest, geeky records, and they foreground McNew's idiosyncracies (like his thin, high-pitched voice, which has pretty much the same failings and lovability as Neil Young's) and tastes in other people's music. But theirs is the kind of modesty that complements McNew's formidable gifts.He was still immodest enough to name his debut album after its best original song-- although putting the handwritten words \"artist\" and \"superpowerless\" on a front cover was very much in line with the indie pop rhetoric of 1993, when everybody was claiming to be a loser. album under-promises, which allows it to over-deliver: it's basically an album as a mixtape-with-handwritten-tracklist, with a good mixtape's sense of flow and contrast. Its main lyrical theme is trying to make connections with other lonely people, which is also the mechanism of its creation.Some of its songs are nicely chosen covers-- Sun Ra, Wreckless Eric, \"Moon River\" --and others are deeply indebted to a particular artist: \"19 1/2\" is a stab at Melvins-y heaviness, and \"Broken Conscience\" genuflects in the direction of Tall Dwarfs' Slugbuckethairybreathmonster (so did the title of Yo La Tengo's Painful, released the same year). The sweetest response to a favorite record here is \"Ode to Shaggs' Own Thing\", on which McNew reproduces Dot Wiggin's uncertain guitar tone to nip and tuck the Shaggs' awkward instrumental into something a little more graceful. (The new reissue appends an earlier Dump EP and a few compilation tracks.)If album is a sketch of what McNew's solitary space looked like, I Can Hear Music is a portrait of him in a community, especially its second disc, recorded with some of the other performers from the 1994 Fast Forward music festival in the Netherlands. Barbara Manning duets with McNew on the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band's \"I Want to Be With You\"; Chris Knox, who had supposedly never played trumpet before, blurts a double-tracked solo on the Ronettes/Beach Boys tune \"I Can Hear Music.\"The first disc is another bucket from the same well as album: home recordings with their cassette-tape artifacts reproduced as tokens of sincerity; pastiches of favorite bands (\"Don't Let On\" is approximately a My Bloody Valentine-style chord progression); instrumental sketches that never quite got promoted to finished songs but have something about them that holds the sequence together; covers that either work nicely with McNew's voice (Ultravox's \"Vienna\") or are sturdy enough to work just fine despite it (Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan's \"Wanted Man\"). McNew's strongest original songs are frontloaded this time: \"Slow Down\" and \"Hope, Joe\" still turned up in set lists when Yo La Tengo did their \"spinning wheel\" tour a few years ago and occasionally ended up playing a set of Dump material.That seems to have been the fate of this project: McNew's songwriting got integrated into Yo La Tengo once it was clear that their 15th bassist was the one who was sticking around. He's been singing the occasional song with Yo La Tengo since 1997, and the last Dump album was 2003's A Grown-Ass Man, with only a handful of compilation tracks released since then. These first two albums are deliberately minor and unambitious, sometimes nearly to the point of abjection. They're also treasures in a way that only small, flawed, homemade things can be.\n",
            "Gaza's last album was called He Is Never Coming Back. The \"He\" in the title refers to God. Around the time of the record's release in 2009, vocalist Jon Parkin was quoted as saying \"He Is Never Coming Back is a knife pushed slowly through the temple and into humanity's primitive religiousness. It is a call to utilize the same logic and reason applied in every other aspect of our lives in the assessment of theology.\" And when I spoke to him about the record shortly after it came out, he told me, \"We wanted this record to pick you up and death shake you like a dog would snap a rabbit's neck. And to once in a while stop to lick the blood running from your nose.\" The frontman, who is 6'7\", and wears his hair close-cropped, clearly isn't afraid to use colorful language when making a point. The music's just as intense and amped on album, the Salt Lake City, Utah, grindcore band's third album-- and best to date.It works so well because they find a balance between melody and cacaphony. The 11-song collection was produced by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou, who gives Gaza's warped blend of grind, hardcore, and crust a dense, sturdy feel. On their Facebook, the band calls what they do \"progressive crust\" and \"math piss.\" The first works, but I might change the latter to \"math pissed off.\" Like Gaza's past work, the music here is a dense and intense, a twisting, churning spin on noisy grind with a tendency toward rock'n'roll. The songs, with their constant warping mutations, feel like they're melting. Outside the more mid-tempo title track, and the closing dirge, it's unrelenting. Even when songs are longer-- the six-minute \"Not With All the Hope in the World\", which moves from a blur to a beautiful sludge anthem, to that surprisingly plaintive, doom closer \"Routine and Then Death\"-- the pieces never stop throwing unexpected shifts at you. \"The Vipers\" melds hyper grind, a mid-tempo breakdown, indelible melody, and a noise-rock pep talk. It's a dexterous showing: math rock made up of violent equations.In a self-penned bio, the group refers to themselves as \"failed emo musicians.\" A joke, maybe, but there is plenty of emotion and emoting here. Parkin reminds me of a short story writer in some ways, or Converge's Jacob Bannon writing for Harvey Milk. His lyrics are sketches and observations that move from the economy (\"I understand we have invented ourselves out of a job\"), playful anti-religiousness (\"It sure was nice of Jesus to take time away from ignoring/ Ethnic cleansing genocide and famine-bloated children/ Or regrowing limbs for landmine victims/ To help you score that touchdown\"), the generally political (\"Know your children will know more of this earth than you ever will/ You should be embarrassed/ I can hear them laughing at their history books\"), to tracks that remind me of punk zine Cometbus, or the poetic manifestos of the anarchist collective Crimethinc. In \"Routine and Then Death\", for example, the only words we get are \"It's the same noise every day/ We walk back and forth.\" Parkin finds a way out of that cycle in \"Skull Trophy\" via \"a deer carcass someone had cleanly taken the head off of\" that he passes in his car. As he puts it, in a way that I find fairly romantic, \"I thought of you/ I knew you'd find it full of wonder/ Someone had desecrated a corpse for a sportless opportunistic skull trophy/ That alone is some hillbilly shit/ But the bigger picture is that we've lost feeling in our left arm.\" Best pickup line of the year.For all the challenging complexity, this is music that sticks in your head. No Absolutes opens with the wobbling post-rocking drone of \"Mostly Hair and Bones Now\"-- the track ushers in a huge grind explosion after 50 seconds-- and moves through the AmRep muscularity of the title track to the proggy soloing/post-rock slipperiness of \"name\" to the jazz breakdowns at the start of \"Skull Trophy\". You get the point. Amid all this chaos, though, there's calm. Amid the anger and bile, a discernable beauty. Gaza are a rare band in this way-- an uncompromising group that should appeal to folks who don't usually stock grindcore in their music collection, all without trying, in the least, to win them over.\n",
            "Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji enjoyed a rich musical legacy during his lifetime. He is credited as being one of the first musicians to bring genuine African music to Western ears en masse, having burst on the scene in 1959 with his debut, Drums of Passion. It was the first known album of traditional West African drumming and chants to be recorded in the United States (Olatunji moved to Atlanta in 1950 before relocating permanently to New York City), and was released during a high tide of political and cultural change-- including appearing alongside epochal jazz recordings by Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, and Ornette Coleman. As listeners were exposed to different styles and the collective interest in world music and jazz continued to grow in popularity, Olatunji helped turn people's attention away from the corny melodies that dominated the exotica genre fad by offering authentic, captivating songs from his native homeland.Six years after Olatunji's death at age 75, and 50 years after its original release, Drums of Passion has received the deluxe treatment as a beautifully packaged 2xCD containing its companion album More Drums of Passion (1966) and a well-chosen smattering of jazz-influenced bonus tracks, some of which were previously unreleased in the U.S. It also benefits from considerate remastering: the sound snaps with color, defining the rhythmic fabric with greater clarity while illuminating the integrity and magnetic intensity of Olatunji's arrangements. In some ways, the impact of this sonic resuscitation feels even more vital on a recording that is structured primarily by multiple tiers of voice and percussion, as the distinction between them were often tricky to capture, particularly in studios with comparatively limited equipment.Olatunji frequently drafted a vivacious, disparate ensemble of musicians and vocalists to contribute to his recordings, and many of these people drifted in and out of the studio unknown and unaccredited. By its very nature, his music is designed to be performed by large groups-- it is this communal input that gives Drums of Passion its infectious vitality and relentlessly entertaining energy. The elated female and male chants on \"Odun De! Odun De! (Happy New Year)\" glide over a knot of polyrhythms, while the call and response vocals on \"Baba Jinde (Flirtation Dance)\" are injected with so many whoops and jeers that the song ends up sounding like a pack of copulating hyenas, pinned down by a surge of ecstatic Afro-Cuban rhythms.\"The spirit of the drum is something that you feel but cannot put your hands on,\" Olatunji once explained to an interviewer. \"It does something to you from the inside out. It hits people in so many different ways, but the feeling is one that is satisfying and joyful.\" This zeal lay at the root of Olatunji's music, and is arguably felt more ferociously on Drums of Passion than any other of his many recordings. It may not be as immediately accessible as some of his later work, but in terms of improvisational liveliness and the sheer animation of his rhythmic phrasing and arrangements, it’s hard to beat. Over the last several decades, fans of world music have had access to a plethora of material from all over the globe. But it's worth retracing the steps to this virtuoso, who not only brought genuine West African music to popular attention but also influenced musicians such as Quincy Jones, the Grateful Dead, and Bob Dylan. Olatunji was a remarkable entertainer, whose impression on world music is as enjoyable and significant now as it was in the early 1960s. He has achieved a gold standard in music: Timelessness, and an ardor that does not simply simmer but glows fiercely, and joyfully, from within.\n",
            "Tour the Art Institute on Silkworm's Chicago turf and use reverse chronology as the organizing principal of your walkthrough. Start in the contemporary art rooms and move through four-hundred-plus years of Individual Masters, then a long ways back to the rooms showcasing ancient pieces. You can work up a pretty good bummer realizing how you're forced to herald the lone, rare Singular Geniuses, only to end up looking at treasures made by anonymous members of communities in which most people were artisans of some kind, capable of at least perfunctorily creative craftsmanship. If you're in the right pissy, generalizing mood, you can wonder if we slather over Geniuses out of a kind of guilt because they tap into something that we deep-down know shouldn't be so rare. Since most of us can barely figure out how to feed ourselves, we jump at the chance to applaud anyone with some leftover specialness. The whole mess is enough to make you tired of the accidental fascism of Geniuses filling supposedly organic 'leadership vacuums,' offering us chances to confirm our inferiority as we stand in the crowd at their concerts, or go to their movies, or read their books, viewing our consumption of them as sufficiently sophisticated and 'artistic' enough to justify the rest of our afternoon's being spent playing video games or bitching at our sex-pals or staring at the ceiling or crying into our cans of Surge. Okay, that kneejerk theory is stoops: I know that 'the people' aren't going to rise up from quoting Aflac commercials to start an artistic revolution, and even if it did happen I bet I'd sleep through the best parts. Even back-burner geniuses have consistent work ethics. Plus, those shangri-la ancient art-cultures probably didn't have access to convenient toilets of every personality-reflecting color. Alls I'm saying is that we gotta practice moderation and stop demanding that every album announce an Elvrum or Mangum or Yorke. As soon as you ease up on the need for a new disposable Jesus to mimic, you realize that there's a lot to be said for the refreshing geniuslessness of bands like Silkworm. Silkworm has no star to fantasize about sleeping with. No dominating image or attitude emerges to influence your hairstyle. The lyrics never leave you throttled by the image of them being read out of a Damn-I'm-Clever Notebook #47. Instead of life-affirming passion, their albums, album gloriously included, offer subtle slapstick nihilism. Their website makes several references to how shocked they are that they still exist, and it dubs their own discography \"shit we have shat.\" Their concert journals humbly acknowledge that their slippery fit-rock is often incidental music for drunks to fidget and commingle to. Maybe the Genius thing is a factor in sustainability; it's hard to listen to what Pavement and Silkworm were doing ten years ago and conclude that Silkworm would outlast the other. They get overlooked as old-guard almost-weres, but an elite armada of folks with extensive CD budgets remain rightfully grateful for their unambitious clamor. album, whose packaging is so minimal that it's a waste of paper, is the band's best release since 1996's whoopass and splashy Firewater, though it just sounds like uninviting racket the first time you hear it, and it continues Firewater's preoccupation with alcohol. In other words, if Firewater is their OK Libations, this disc is their Kid AA-- slightly more penitent and therefore a great soundtrack for a punitive post-hangover jog. Anyone who has ever dropped a bottle opener and then broken their finger trying to get it out from behind the fridge will appreciate \"Bourbon Beard\" and its sloshy, regretful counterparts. Coach Albini once again corroborates their convulsive assault, micing the guitars and vocals warmly, while the bass and drums maintain his standard warplane-hangar dynamics. The sound is earthily underscored by all manner of piano, organ, clavinet, and synthy touches, as well as guest vocalist Kelly Hogan's counterintuitive heartthroat. Silkworm brings the chops, working odd pauses into their solos like J. Mascis undergoing physical therapy. Riffs abound, some Kirk Hammett fretfests go down, and whammy bars occasionally peer out to inspire air-guitarists everywhere. The abundance of classic tropes (axe histrionics, anthemic refrain buildups, epic breakdowns, backup 'bops' and 'oohs') will leave you trying to gauge the band's sincerity. Are they spoofing what's been done to death, or nominating themselves as deserving candidates to give the oft-resurrected rock horse a respectful, hellacious kick? album is a slow-burner, an acquired taste, like, uh, Pawpaw's hard liquor. It grew on everyone I know who was in proximity to multiple spins, reducing several of them to murmuring choruses from hits like the opener \"(I Hope U) Don't Survive,\" the retro shoutalong \"The Old You,\" the no-wave \"The Brain,\" the pollution-happy hoedown \"Dirty Air,\" and the clunkily-titled but killer \"A Cockfight of Feelings,\" a mud-puddle reminder that the verse-chorus-verse formula can be a lil' abstruse. Even the subdued, repetitive \"Moving,\" which is about moving in the unmetaphorical way that the Go-Gos' \"Vacation\" was about vacations, colonizes your tune-lobe. If only radio switched to an all-scab format, Silkworm's lurch-and-bounce could be credited for embracing the obvious throb of concise garage-prog-- a style you could call, to quote one of this album's few bombs, \"world-proof.\"\n",
            "In order to realize his brutal musical vision with Yeezus, Kanye West enlisted a congregation’s worth of collaborators with a highly diversified range of skills: honeyed indie crooners, European EDM wunderkinds, luminary rock producers, M.I.A.’s former fiancé. Another helping hand was lent by Mike Levy, the French producer who records and performs as Gesaffelstein. He worked on the bruising, stadium-ready “Black Skinhead” and the raucous, emergency-lit “Send It Up” alongside label mate Brodinski and sonic grandfathers Daft Punk, among others.A quick glimpse at Gesaffelstein’s professional mythology is all it takes to understand the heart of his appeal to West: a shared interest in art and fashion, a personal aesthetic possessed of palpable intensity and ripe with darkness and violence, and an eye towards intellectual concerns broader than music. (It’s captured neatly in his chosen moniker: Gesaffelstein is a portmanteau that combines the German word “gesamtkunstwerk,” meaning “universal artwork,” and Albert Einstein, an inspirational figure.) His debut album album fuses those pre-existing aspirations to ideas about style that feel directly derived from his work with West, with its cover—a jewel case containing a gold disc, the case overlaid with complex patterns reminiscent of circuitry—serving as the most obvious hat tip.It’s a testament to Levy’s talent, and to the strength of his sonic identity, that album merits comparison to Yeezus in terms of its thematic consistency and coherence. From the ferocious spoken introduction that marks opener “Out of Line” (one of several appearances by Parisian vocalist Chloé Raunet) to the slowly rising sirens echoing throughout “Perfection”, this is an absolutely relentless record: there’s no sunlight to be had on album. Levy specializes in two types of songs: fiery, raging bangers meant for the dank club at the end of the world, and meditative mood pieces that bubble and loom while you’re fighting through the next morning’s hangover. Thoughtful sequencing choices help to amplify the magnitude of the difference between the members of these phylums, and have the added benefit of lending album a natural-seeming cycle of attack and release. When doom-soaked, muscular lead single “Pursuit” glides into the ominous, slowly shifting “Nameless”, it’s as if we’ve been given a well-earned breather after enduring the intense assault of the former.It’s a trick Levy pulls multiple times without diluting its effect, made possible by the tonal differences between the album’s higher-octane tracks: “Send It Up” relative “Hellifornia” pairs a trunk-ratting hip-hop rhythm with a howling, DEFCON 1-level screech, while “Duel” earns its combative title by pitting a furious, hyper-kinetic beat against a friction-fried synth that refuses to let up. While the album’s dark, dance-ready techno cuts certainly demand their fair share of attention, Levy takes advantage of the album’s quieter moments and displays surprising levels of subtlety and restraint. With its eerie guitar melodies and digital choruses of the damned, the title track could slot neatly into a collection of outtakes from the Drive soundtrack; mid-album counterpart “Wall of Memories” fares even better, bulging and warping underneath a haunted piano line. By making room for both potential floor-filling wrecking balls and quieter, spookier moments on album, Levy sets himself up as the sort of transcendental figure who can fill up festival EDM tents full of drop enthusiasts while simultaneously appealing to listeners who consider themselves more nuanced consumers of contemporary electronic material.If album has a weakness, it's the album's lack of concision. At around an hour, this is a lengthy, demanding record, and the relentless push that constitutes a major part of its excitement in small blocks renders it somewhat exhausting when ingested as a whole. While some of the strongest songs—the stomach-churning “Hate or Glory”, the piston-powered techno workout “name”—are tucked near its conclusion, it takes an effort to make it to the finish line. The importance of brevity is a lesson Levy didn't pickup after working on Yeezus, a similarly dark record that clocks in at a brisk 40 minutes. A distillation of the sounds and themes contained within album into an equally slim package would render his next record truly fearsome.\n",
            "The vast, blurry landscape of a trip: when you're flying, details are sometimes hard to make out, other times they're enhanced. Sometimes, letting go is the easiest way to get your grip, and as any traveler will tell you, getting there is almost all of the fun. Get it? Unless you're completely wasted, probably not-- this is the crux of stoner wisdom, wherein often you're the only one who knows that you're right. Maybe that's why music made under these circumstances is usually so out there. It probably made sense at the time for Tim Leary and Manuel Gottsching to make all those strange sounds, but to the indifferent observer they are something else altogether. This isn't to say chemically enhanced music only makes sense to the tuned in and turned on, but I'd argue it's probably much easier to find common ground when you're high. Enter Finland's Pharaoh Overlord, a project led by guitarist Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle, themselves good for a lengthy excursion or three into outer space. The flavor on their second release is decidedly passive where Circle are prone to brute force. Rather than concoct trance via mere repetition, Pharaoh Overlord realize that the quickest way to a sedated heart is to ease in gradually, massaging all the rough edges away and keeping the traveler effortlessly afloat. Fuck, more herb nonsense-- anyway, you probably get the idea. If not, may I suggest that these guys come off like an intensely comfortable version of Acid Mothers Temple, minus all that guitar squealing nonsense. For the straight-edgers in the audience, just consider it the next best thing to warm milk before bed. \"name\" wastes little time establishing the mildly disorientating quease-trance that Pharaoh Overlord specialize in. A gauze of distant, howling breeze covers the minimal guitar-bass-drums vamp like a layer of heavy white smoke. The sound approaches lo-fi even as the layers of soft noise build, giving the tune an ominous, hazy depth. The band play everything pretty slow, and prefer extremely minor variations on the same basic riff played continuously, rather than muck up the mix with extraneous \"psychedelic\" effects (Cotton Casino, I'm looking in your direction). Likewise, \"Dark Temper\" wrings plenty of mileage out of its snaky, pseudo-blues thang using little more than that same smoggy veneer and surprisingly subtle guitar figures. The end result is like a younger cousin to Ted Nugent's \"Stranglehold\" crossed with Funkadelic's \"Music for Your Mother\", but with no vocals, you're free to follow your own narrative. Slightly less engaging is \"Skyline\", if only because it tends to follow the more obvious path to bliss via mind-numbing repetition. There's a good chance you'll have the main riff from this tune permanently ingrained after hearing it a few times-- whether or not that translates to ever wanting to play it again depends on your affinity for pre-school blues riffery (and general level of patience). \"August\" and \"Love Unfiltered\" opt for acoustic textures, though not at the expense of the already well-stated preference for sludgy garage rock grooves. The former tune is almost folky, with a dual finger picked guitar attack, good for back porch revelations on a dead-hot summer evening. The latter is more overtly spacey, though in truth, the differences between these two songs (and much of the album) might well come down to how willing you are to be hypnotized: waiting for \"something\" to happen is probably beside the point. album won't change the face of rock, or even psyche-rock. There are literally hundreds of albums from the late 60s and early 70s out there that will do a similar trick, though I suppose if you aren't willing to scour eBay like greasy collector scum, Pharaoh Overlord can provide a valuable service at a fraction of the price. Like any decent trip, this music will serve you best when you've cleared your mind, sat back and accepted that you aren't going anywhere beyond the bizarre corridors of your mind. Motherfucker, I just lapsed into that shit again! Anyway...you know what I'm talkin' about, man.\n",
            "Rocket from the Crypt's album was the band's sophomore album, originally released by Cargo/Headhunter Records in 1993. You'll recall that, in the early 90s, major labels seeking to emulate the runaway success of Nirvana were signing every promising indie band they could get their hands on, and Rocket from the Crypt's distinctive blend of meat-and-potatoes rock, raging punk, tattooed and pomaded greaser style, and kitschy Americana must have fit the bill. Interscope took the bait, and the record was a minor hit, garnering college and commercial radio play, and even MTV videos for \"Ditchdigger\" and \"Sturdy Wrist\". But the circumstances of the signing remain shrouded in mystery, as RFTC has an odd propensity to fill their press releases with apocrypha: The band hilariously claims to have signed to Interscope for $70 million, and sold the label the rights to re-release album for an additional $32 million, which reveals RFTC as an ambitious band that doesn't shy away from a publicity generating hoax here and there. And who could blame them for doing whatever it takes to separate themselves from the horde? Allegedly, Interscope asked RFTC to record four new songs for their re-release of album, but got tired of waiting and released the record with its original tracklist intact. Regardless of whether this is fact or another red herring, it's certain that there are four never-before-released tracks on Swami's reissue (hence the \"+4\" in the title). The original and bonus tracks have all been remastered from the original quarter-inch transfers, and profit from the hi-fi yet dirty tone. As album +4 is an early album in a long and storied career that's seen the band amass a devout cult following (as well as for frontman John Reis' other projects, the seminal post-hardcore band Drive Like Jehu and its modern scion, Hot Snakes), it lacks the polish and realization of vision displayed by later albums like the Interscope-funded RFTC, but is solid nevertheless, and resolutely pointed in the direction RFTC would eventually take: distorted, sneering vocals; deep licks of pummeling bass and revving guitars; and brassy saxophone flourishes galore. Drony and propulsive at once, with more midtempo swagger than can be found on their amped-up later fare, album +4 might even be preferable to the more refined later work to listeners who like to take things a little slower. album +4 opens with \"Short Lip Fuser\", a deviation from the prevalent loud/soft dynamic of its grungy era. It's just fucking loud, a sonic embodiment of the screaming headache I'm nursing as I write (occupational hazard: why couldn't I be reviewing Low today instead of Chris Ott?). It's a dramatic and pace-setting start, with a raw-boned opening riff that gradually accelerates through a morass of feedback to find its counterpoint and lock on to the marshal cadence of the drums, before suddenly DOUBLING IN VOLUME with an effect akin to that of opening a rock club's door midset. (By the way, before you write in to point out my self-contradiction, the correct volume signature here is not loud/soft, but loud/LOUD. Make a note.) \"Hippy Dippy Do\" represents the rockabillyish side of RFTC, with its initial, flash-fried guitar figure going up and down like a rusty zipper, then jamming up in little tangles of pop/punk chugging. The uncharacteristically mopey \"Ditchdigger\" (by the Swami's turban, is this Social Distortion covering Jawbreaker?), with its regal, harmonic-laden ice sculpture of a melody, is an early standout, as is the swaggering dick-walk of \"Hairball Alley\". The first bonus track, the seemingly underdeveloped \"Lamps for Sale\", does become more engaging when a fleeting horn line and upper-register guitar enliven the uninspired riff. \"Crazy Talk\" is more distinctive, with pointillistic drills of tightly controlled thrash pinioned by rigid percussion, a lively vocal melody, and hair-raising reiterated rock breakdowns. The bonus tracks are rounded out by the lubricated, unfettered thrust of \"Flight of the Hobo\" and pop/punk prototype \"Over the Rail\". As I said: solid. Rocket from the Crypt may get a kick out of duping the press, but their music ain't no joke. Pitchfork's former resident RFTC booster Nick Mirov is gonna be sewing a new Rocket patch on his bowling shirt for this one.\n",
            "Oh God, hang on to your tar pits, because leaping out from behind the Krispy Kreme pay phone comes a selection of FUN FACTS ABOUT THIS CD! Read on! AMOUNT MERGE APPARENTLY SPENT ON THE PACKAGING: Thirty-five cents. POP ICON WHOM SUGGS MOST RESEMBLES: Matt is, fascinatingly, the lycanthropine doppelganger of the big brother from The Goonies. ARTIST THIS ALBUM MOST TRUMPS: Frank Black-- not to be confused with Black Francis or Charles Thompson. album is the mature-but-not-boring, laid-way-back singer/songwriter album that Black's been struggling to half-make for years. Suggs' embodiment of the Pixie-cum-pooper is uncanny, down to the lisp, spaciness, and the nervous, breathy falsetto. Intimations of Black Francis' girl-name-dropping Bossanova do bubble up, though, as Suggs croons him some Clementines, Janies, and Hannahs. ARTIST MOST HAUNTING THIS ALBUM: Stephen Malkmus. Suggs' old band Butterglory (who themselves most haunt the hyper tease \"Calm Down\") couldn't escape Pavement Junior labels, despite their growth from a college-radio-rock-by-numbers lo-fi concern into the guiteurs of Are You Building a Temple in Heaven? and the standoffish New Zealandry of Rat-Tat-Tat. The Wedding Present even covered both bands (Pavement's \"Box Elder\" and Butterglory's \"Waiting on the Guns\"). Suggs' two solo discs have weirdly paralleled the permanent-afternoon trip-pop of Malkmus' two self-helmed excursions. This album's \"Jonathan Montgomery\" chugs along on a mean, Frosty-thick, mid-70s riff similar in sasstiness to SM's \"Black Book\", even if Suggs' track pauses for piano-bar buildups. EXTRATEXTUAL REASONS TO SAMPLE THIS DISC'S MELLOW GOLD: Contrary to Digital Underground's hardsell, no one ever invented sex packets. The department store Dillard's features a \"punk\" clothing section. People are using \"oxycontin\" as a verb, like \"rollin\" or \"ballin.\" Plastic surgeons are working to get small breasts considered a medical condition (\"micromastia\"). FILM THIS ALBUM MOST EVOKES: Jesus' Son. Some stumbly, tragicomic, Arizonian quality in this record fits Alison Maclean's debut adaptation of Denis Johnson's overbeloved drug stories. If Maclean was male, she would have been heralded as a gawk-plex messiah. BUT YOU KNOW: All these border-town lyrics about \"Tehachapi girls\" have got me thinking Suggs favors an anoxeric Benicio del Torso. WORST SONG: \"New Year\". They's even a reference to that song that rhymes with \"Mold Fang Whine\". They's even a reference to resolutions. This pianode is unfortunately the closest Suggs comes to sentimentality, though his speaker is still all intoxicated and trapped and alienated. I just don't get these Gregorian-significance poses. An indie Elton Joel, anyone? Mom? Mulchpile? ALTERNATE TITLES THAT WOULD HAVE WORKED: Albuquerque Nosebleeds. Painting Ranchy Patterns in the Cojones Hotel Lobby. ACTUAL NEU-HIPPIE NAME OF BACKING BAND: Thee Higher Burning Fire. Consider an Anomoanon being dry-gulched by The Band in a world where The Band formed after The Velvet Underground had busted up. MOST MYSTERIOUS SONG: \"Father\". Yes! Where could a fella order a whole set of tracks like this one, which cops a Taps-tone and might be about some kind of assassination? The speaker is being tracked down by horsemen, and his father is as impotent as the dad in J.M.Coetzee's Disgrace. The lack of explanation adds so much to the song's passionate creeps. Thee Higher Burning Fire plinks and plods with such coherent grace that I must scream to you the virtues of how excellently Brian \"Sure, I'll Produce It\" Paulson captured the crispness of the four November days when this record became data. BEST OPENING LINES: This honor goes to \"Darling Hannah\", which begins, \"You were rapping on and on about some hocus pocus virtue/ That carried you away to the downtown fuck scene.\" Wow. I told you this thing was Malkmus-haunted. The song accretes to constitute an excellent wedge of Suggs' strident saloonism, eventually abandoning the predictable plane of breakup songs and vaulting itself into the slutmosphere, or maybe the regretmosphere.\n",
            "As Cologne’s Kompakt ran out the final length of its yearlong 20th anniversary victory lap in 2013, it did so with the faint whiff of a label whose later output has been rendered slightly stale by repetition. This is a familiar paradox for lots of iconic imprints in their golden years, especially those whose worldview is more constitutional than searching: the more blueprinted and carefully curated an aesthetic, the more difficult it is to evolve. Over the last 20 years, Kompakt’s make a mark on dance music, honed its neatly-defined output down to pure science and put a tidy frame around it’s history. What next?If not for DJ Koze’s inspired 2013 breakthrough LP Amygdala (which actually came out on his own label, Pampa), one could make the argument that it’s been years since any of Kompakt’s old guard have hit paydirt. Although perfectly pleasant, Michael Mayer’s late 2012 full-length Mantasy failed to move the needle, while fellow tentpole Superpitcher’s been mostly MIA since 2010. Even the label’s once-lauded compilations like Total and Pop Ambient have suffered from serious quality-control issues of late. Justus Köhncke doesn’t get the column inches of a Mayer or a Superpitcher, but he’s one of the Kompakt’s longest-serving and most representative artists. album is his first full-length since 2008’s Safe & Sound; as unfair as it is to the artist, it’s tempting to look to it as an indicator of the label’s current health.Sadly, that narrative remains unresolved. Although TWFB boasts a characteristic mix of mid-tempo house, techno, disco and kitschy pop, it’s hardly a definitive statement. As with all of Köhncke’s work, it’s also infused with a whimsy that could be mistaken for indifference. That whimsy plays best when it’s applied to disco; in addition to boasting the greatest three-word distillation of Kompakt’s worldview yet, opener “Flitter Und Tand” (translation: “frippery and kitsch”) houses a slinky bassline and a charmingly goofy spoken word refrain that ranks among Köhncke’s most endearing and infectious moments. Likewise, lead single “name” is a particularly strong vintage of the aerodynamic disco-house hybrid for which Köhncke (and Kompakt) have come to be known. Tellingly, the album’s standout moment feels miles away from Köhncke’s comfort zone; the singer-songwriterly “Wonderful Frequency Band” boasts gently picked acoustic guitars and pianos, a swelling chorus, and absolutely nothing in the way of a 4/4.But that sort of boundary pushing is in short supply here. Even at it’s best, TWFB is mostly just a well-crafted collection of genre exercises; a few too many tracks, like the motorik double whammy of “Das Selbstgespräch” and “Idee, Prozess, Ergebnis” and the ironically-titled “A New Direction”, are standard-issue deep cuts that offer little in the way of surprise. As evidenced by the goofy artwork and the album’s wide-eyed title, Köhncke’s interested in new ways of framing his work as a solo techno artist, but no metaphor, however offbeat, is deep enough to substitute for real surprise.\n",
            "Now is the time on Pitchfork when we dance! As part of a court-ordered apology for unleashing Fatboy Slim on an unsuspecting universe, the Astralwerks label has undertaken the incredibly noble task of re-releasing the first three albums by the legendary Düsseldorf duo Neu. The albums are to be played round the clock at Astralwerks HQ; the cheap Crayon graphics of the compact disc are to be pinned on shirts like scarlet letters; all employees are to dance the Robot at all times. We need to praise Neu like we should.As far back as I can remember, the first three Neu albums languished in the Import-only Impossible; the Japanese letters on the sleeves were incomprehensible, but also painfully explicit: prohibitively expensive, they screamed. And now, their stateside release has opened up unimagined worlds to the ears, cheap!And like the band's moniker promises, this music is new. Strange and visionary, but so incredibly familiar. Why? Because a record originally cut in 1972 by a splinter off the indomitable Kraftwerk has seeped into the musical consciousness of a generation; its influence is everywhere. Listening to Neu recalls that giddy, pointless thrill of standing at the Four Corners in the southwestern United States. What's the big deal? Well, nothing, really, except maybe the sense of being in many places at once. That's Neu: standing with cocked German eyebrows at the nexus of shimmering space rock, processed psychedelia, mechanical kraut, and wonderfully libidinal disco.Upon hearing \"Hallo Gallo,\" the first track on Neu, a friend of mine started inadvertently humming an organ line from Tortoise's \"Djed.\" That quiet gesture summed up the album for me: listening to the past and hearing so much of the future. But Neu is no mere missing link. \"Hallo Gallo\" is a masterpiece of rhythm: tight drums, funky guitar scratch, a coolly insistent bassline, futuro synths, and effects-laden guitar slinging wide acid-fried launches into deep space. Neu is remarkably economical where its influences cultivate excess: the exploratory guitar and keyboards discover new aural landscapes where the pioneers of prog would remain hours blissfully adrift. \"Hallo Gallo\" is intelligent dance music in every sense of the term: it's the ass inviting the mind out onto the floor. Nobody leads; both are simply in motion.\"Sonderangebot\" is a murky soup of noise and silence: an interlude of clanging cymbals, and ambient fuzz, a kind of breathing nebula. The song bleeds darkly into \"Weißensee,\" a droning parade of dirty, cone-filtered guitar that anticipates the pastoral psychedelia of Flying Saucer Attack and Hochenkeit. \"Negativland\" opens in jackhammer drills and coalesces into a lock-tight, bass-driven martial progression of stabbing guitar and industrial noise: it's dark but strangely danceable. Something like krautpunk: syncopation, cerebral and serrated.Neu is music with the proper documentation: it passes from one musical realm to another without the jackbooted border patrol so much as blinking an eye: this is sound with the highest level security clearance. And when it shifts from one sound to the next, it never winks at you with postmodern irony, never elbows you in the ribs to let you in on the joke. Neu is truly a citizen of the musical universe, at home everywhere and everywhere at once. And Astralwerks' re-release of this phenomenal debut could only serve as a long overdue recognition of this fact. For perhaps without Neu, there would have been no Astralwerks; worse, without Neu there may have been no Pitchfork. Neu anticipates us all. Now who's your daddy? Come on, say it!\n",
            "For 15 years, Rachel Goswell has been known first as a member of Slowdive and then as one-third of Mojave 3. In the first group and on the latter group's 1996 debut, Ask Me Tomorrow, Goswell shared vocal duties on 9 songs with frontman Neil Halstead, but on the three albums that followed, Halstead sang every song but one-- \"Comin' Home\" from Excuses for Travelers (which he wrote). Goswell's willowy, expressive voice always seemed like a potentially dynamic counterpart to Halstead's understated whisper, but it was mostly an underused asset. Instead, she usually hung back on bass and only occasionally supplied backing vocals, certainly to the frustration of fans desperate to hear more from the woman who gave \"Love Songs on the Radio\" its elegiac elegance. So Goswell's own solo debut, entitled album, seems not just long overdue, but, more critically, freighted with the high expectations of a horde of eager listeners. On the album's lead-off track, \"Warm Summer Sun\", Goswell meets those expectations head-on. Over a gentle guitar strum, she sings about falling over from lack of forward motion and decides not to \"waste my time on things that stop me feeling.\" Drums and guitar kick in for the second verse and the song builds gradually. SPOILER ALERT: Then traditional Irish uilleann pipes come in loud and jarring, like a Shyamalan twist ending that completely reframes everything that preceded it. Suddenly, the song is not just a smell-the-roses reaffirmation, but a statement of career resolve. If the beginning seems like a distillation of Mojave 3's strengths, the pipes serve the same purpose of Slowdive's droning guitars: Goswell has found the hidden connections between her current group's pastoralisms and her former band's shoegazerisms. Unfortunately, little else on album lives up to the promise of \"Warm Summer Sun\", though a couple of songs do come close: \"Deelay\" overlays loping rhythms with one of the album's most evocative melodies, while \"Coastline\" and \"Save Yourself\" churn with eddying guitars whose raggedness contrasts nicely with Goswell's crystalline voice. But the rest of the album dispenses with the murky guitars in favor of burbling percussion, tasteful acoustic strumming, and occasional flourishes like the birdchirp samples and breathy harmonium in \"Gather Me Up\". Producer David Naughton incorporates a dizzying array of instruments-- shakers, Wurlitzer, vibraphone, bongos, letterbox bells, and rain stick. Three songs even credit Mother Nature on Thai waves, rain and ambience. Such inventive accompaniment, however, often overcompensates for weak song structures, lackluster lyrics, and a general lack of focus. Over 12 tracks, Goswell undertakes a range of musical approaches, from quiet folk to more conventional rock to jangly pop, but not all of them work equally well. Softer, midtempo songs like \"Thru the Dawn\" and \"Shoulder the Blame\" lag with inertia, and \"No Substitute\" is polished to a characterless AOR sheen (she can sound startlingly similar to Shawn Colvin). \"Hope\" expresses the frustrations of city life, but the banal lyrics (\"You give me space to live in/ You give me hope/ And that's just fine\") and Naughton's overproduction-- especially the chorus of back-up singers-- buff away the music's texture and tension. The result is a warm summery sound that's agreeable, if not very exciting. Goswell proves she's more than just another pretty voice, but too often album sounds less than confident, almost timid. The album's ambition is rich musical diversity, but it sounds less adventurously eclectic than simply scattershot, less assertive than merely restless, eager to try anything but not always sure what works and what doesn't.\n",
            " The second album by Canadian singer/songwriter Lullaby Baxter hints at multiple pasts and a candy-coated, just-out-of-reach future. The title, Garden Cities of To-morrow, is a reference to British urban planner Ebenezer Howard's 1902 tome of the same name, which laid out a futuristic vision of communities that married town and country life in a single setting. Howard was also an avid Esperanto speaker and is partly responsible for inspiring Disney's Epcot. Baxter's jazzy alto, meanwhile, carries echoes of singers like Ella Fitzgerald, with a sprinkle of pixie dust rather than the venti cappuccino smoothness of such like-minded chanteuses as Norah Jones and Madeline Peyroux. Pop duo Hercules, who produce, lavish Baxter's songs with the 1960s baroque-pop perfectionism of their overlooked 2004 album, In the Alleyway. Garden Cities of To-morrow lacks the touches of artful noise that intermittently added texture to In the Alleyway, though a few storm-like tendrils do strike the lounge penguin-cruise of \"Antarctica\". Hercules' Peter Baldwin and Ben Sumner are like French duo Air with a yen for orchestras instead of synths and fewer TV commercial gigs. Flugelhorn leans against shy acoustic guitars on \"Little Song\", while standout \"Sugar\" opens with pulsing \"I Am the Walrus\" Mellotron before dissolving in country-rock lead guitar licks, delirious strings, whirling Wurlitzer, and ostinato bass line. A flute quartet, harp, timpani, marimba, and even djembe dress up other tracks in full Herculean garb, with Ennio Morricone's flair for the cinematic. Baxter herself carries on the quirky yet sophisticated style of her 2000 debut Capable Egg, with one foot in over-the-rainbow whimsy and the other in the contemporary singer/songwriter tradition. She's prone to eccentric figurative language that straddles the line between endearing and irritating, depending on your taste: the relatively spare \"Cardboard Armoured Car\" is full of 'em, culminating in \"The world is my potato,\" while the most Jones-like track here, \"name\", jumps from \"you loved me like a circus\" to \"good old Kansas City\". She gets the mixture just right on the aforementioned \"Sugar\": \"Cursed at the moon/ 'til you both turned blue\", as Wurlitzer bends nostalgia into pathos. Garden Cities of To-morrow is an acquired taste: both too weird and too ordinary at once, but when Baxter matches her urbane oddities and Hercules' pastoral popscaping just right, it's like a stroll through leafy, tree-lined city blocks in early autumn twilight. While Baldwin and Sumner have yet to work with songs that perfectly suit their approach, this album's best moments set their distinctive arrangements alongside bits of jazz and fairytale magic, a masterwork of urban planning for a city out of an enchanted kingdom. Not Epcot, though. \n",
            "Edie Sedgwick is not the Edie Sedgwick. Edie Sedgwick is Justin Moyer doing everything you hear and see on this disc. This includes wearing a wig, some makeup, and a spangled black dress. (The press materials say that Moyer has actually undergone a \"gender transformation,\" but given that Moyer, in jeans, t-shirt, and 5-o'clock shadow, is still a member of Supersystem, let's file that fib under Cheeky Hyperbole.) Edie Sedgwick, once upon a time, was Moyer (on bass) and Ryan Hicks (on drums) jamming econo. In both cases, Edie Sedgwick performed songs in a disco-punk fashion named after and concerning celebrities. Moyer's press release claims he does this because \"the world is tired of both meaning and its absence,\" so they create \"substantial song[s] about the substanceless (sic) celebrity.\" To that end, Edie blesses listeners with empty slogans like, \"When Martin Sheen is President/ I love living in the USA\", and \"Relapse, recovery!\" (from \"Robert Downey Jr.\", of course). \"Lucy Liu\" features Moyer chirping \"Girl power!\" and \"Bullshit!\" in front of a spastic Nintendo soundtrack, while \"Michael J. Fox\" makes like Liquid Liquid while riffing on the near-incest of Back to the Future (\"She's in my room/ She knows my moves/ She knows what's hers is mine\"). While Edie claims to be avoiding any meaningful political statement, but there are two tracks about the Governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"I\" is a rinky-dink dirge, bemoaning the sad life of a cyborg (\"All the time I've spent in fields of fire/ No one to hear my cry\"). \"II\", on the other hand, offers quick-hitting rhetoric regarding Ahnuld's rise to power (\"The girlie-men keep us apprised/ Of the alpha-male's meteoric rise\"), and then ends with a party-people roof-raising shout-out to areas of California en fuego (\"San Diego...there's a fire burning/ Angelinos...there's a fire burning\"). These tracks, in addition to \"Martin Sheen\" (drawing a straight line from Apocalypse Now to \"The West Wing\"), and \"Tim Robbins\" (\"Does the left have a fist?\"), undercut the post-post-modern fat-free shenanigans Edie and/or Moyer are trying to have and eat. Even the album title (cribbed from the lyrics to \"Haley Joel Osment\") carries some heft, if you're willing to muse on the nature of the celebrity/fan relationship. To Edie's credit, there are also flights of fancy like the minute-long Big Black homage to Pump Up The Volume, the role call of Colonial Marines in \"Sigourney Weaver\", and the reinvention of Molly Ringwald as a biological weapon, that belie any attempts to arrive at anything remotely approaching significance. Also to Edie's credit, the focus is more on the katzenjammin' Fruity Loops swing than the loopy rhetoric s/he offers. Even if the subjects of the song don't offer much substance, there's plenty of musical meat on the bone. Though, to be totally honest, when \"Martin Sheen\" comes on, I realize that I wouldn't mind living in a USA where Jed Bartlett was president. But I digress. As does Edie Sedgwick. And thank God for that.\n",
            "\"Personal\" is a word that can be used to describe approximately 98% of indie rock that's come out within the past 10 years, but it's still worth stating that singer/songwriter and ex-Titus Andronicus guitarist Andrew Cedermark's debut LP, album, feels incredibly personal. The culmination of a series of scene-stealing split 7\" appearances and featured spots on Underwater Peoples compilations, the album feels homespun, recalling Phil Elverum's defunct Microphones project in its attention to lo-fi detail. Whether he's rocking out or quieting down, you can practically hear him doing his thing in your basement-- well, until the neighbors call the cops, at least.Because, yes there is a lot of rocking out on album-- as you'd expect from an ex-Titus Andronicus guitarist-- and Cedermark lends extra oomph with his muscular guitar playing, which also recalls Elverum's own fancy fretwork. However, his own bombastic sound is far removed from that of his former act. You won't hear many call-to-arms chants or throat-shredding sloganeering here, as Cedermark's songwriting feels a little more introverted, making the sweeping, anthemic bursts of melody that close out \"Ad Infinitum\" and \"Hard Livin'\" less like teenage angst, more post-adolescent catharsis.That intimacy owes more than a little bit to Cedermark's lyrical style, which favors fully realized thoughts and statements addressed in absentia. He writes in complete sentences, e.g. from \"Your Dream Is Killing Me\": \"I could've built a fire with these desires, and if nobody knows, the heat will still glow.\" Elsewhere, on the title track, he expresses a unique disappointment that stems from isolation: \"My loneliness was pure until someone noticed it.\" As hard as it is to lyrically convey one's emotions, it's even harder to achieve that task with a level of artifice, which makes it all the more impressive that Cedermark succeeds at both. When the lyrics on album aren't confessional, they're evocative, even mythical, sure to invoke comparisons to Jeff Mangum.Another trait that album shares with Neutral Milk Hotel's catalog: there's a temptation to overthink this stuff. Resist, and indulge instead in Cedermark's opulently lo-fi excesses. As a front-to-back record, this thing is a monster, with winding melodies that ebb and flow at just the right times, wall-crumbling feedback breakdowns, lots of glockenspiel, and one of the most satisfyingly raucous album closers in some time, \"I Won't Know Me Anymore\". The song kicks off with the burbling croak of horns and works itself into a heavy-strummed lather, as Cedermark sings through static about lust, nostalgia, and stealing beer. Just when you think the tune couldn't get any more gloriously overstuffed with paint-stripping guitar blasts and ramshackle breakdowns, Andrew enters a stream-of-consciousness spoken word rant about his future self's abandoning his family and decamping to a house by the beach: \"I'm gonna live there all alone and watch the waves destroy the shore.\" Wherever he's going, however far off in the future, let's hope he keeps making records like this one.\n",
            "The first single from Little Scream’s second album recasts Laurel Sprengelmeyer as a Bee Gees-indebted art-popper on the grind. The Iowa-born, Montreal-dwelling artist sings in a high, breathy register about fooled hearts and the gift of dance, the flirtatious atmosphere stoked by cheeky guitar and a synth that stutters and slides like a broken zipper. Her 2011 debut, The Golden Record, featured a fair range of guitar-oriented styles—choral post-punk, desert ballads, Horses-indebted spirituals—but nothing as pure pop as this.Rather than a reinvention, though, “Love As a Weapon” is another string to Sprengelmeyer’s considerable bow, and on album, the wealth of styles—tarnished guitar, midnight-hued synths, Eno-indebted balladry—are all pointed in the same direction. To make clear that the record is offering up an alternate reality, the opening interlude is called “Welcome to the Brain,” a spooky riff on the drone of an ensemble tuning up. One song flows into the next, and there are three more interludes across the album’s dozen tracks. Sprengelmeyer brings a similar sense of destination to her individual songs, which rarely end where they started.On The Golden Record, she tilted towards great booming crescendos. Here, she makes agile and surprising shifts between joy, chaos, and vulnerability in the space of a single track. The centerpiece is “Evan,” a song bookended with its own interludes—an ebullient introduction and a haunted outro—which in turn encompasses all her strengths. It starts out as a gentle lullaby, her voice shoring up the melody until it accrues enough chutzpah to turn into a kind of gospel country song. Then thunder strikes, piercing strings swirl, and her vocal refrain takes on a frenzied intensity. Better still is its dark aftermath, “The Kissing,” where Sprengelmeyer’s soft guitar finds its stakes in clangs of staticky fury, a yowling, borderline-prog solo, followed by a choir’s medicated coos, which linger like fallout.album is beautifully orchestrated, and one of the rare records where the lavish arrangements feel fully in service of the songs, rather than like stage decoration. (You could sell the record on its guests—Sufjan Stevens, Sharon Van Etten, the National’s Dessner brothers, TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone, cult Canadian singer Mary Margaret O’Hara—except you can hardly pick them out; they lend their skills rather than personalities.) Sprengelmeyer co-produced with Arcade Fire’s Richard Reed Parry, and they make subtle use of panning and scale to swirl the listener right into the world they’ve created, which hits hard without sacrificing on elegance.In one of the record’s most moving moments, Sprengelmeyer adopts a girlish, scared voice to countenance the possibility of redemption, and of reconciling hurt: “If there are memories I wanna burn/What happens to the ones that I like to keep?” she sings, evoking Bat for Lashes at her most forlorn. “What if my best memories are dreams? Do I get to keep these? Please?” She ends the charade on “Silent Moon,” an eerie, tremulous lament, like Morricone or Angelo Badalamenti arranging for Karen Dalton: “What I loved in you was just projection/A kind rendering of imperfection,” Sprengelmeyer admits, sadly. “Once I saw what was true/There was not much left of you/I’m afraid.”The record is fluid, but front-loaded. After “The Kissing,” an eerie, dreamy mood sets in, and the intensity wavers. But while Sprengelmeyer sacrifices the impact of her second record by stacking uncompromising pop songs at the front and dreamier musings towards the back, her story is tantalizingly non-linear and elliptical. album is a captivating enquiry into the unrelatability of desire, but the conclusiveness of the hurt it can wreak. When it hits, there’s nothing like it.\n",
            "Since they debuted with 2005's Jungles EP, Rahim have imbued the anxious sounds of 1990s D.C. post-punk with a twist of pop savvy. The New York-based quartet skipped over the scrappy, unpolished debut album that's so common to indie bands. They were together for a few years before they released Jungles, but judging solely by their discography, they seem to have emerged fully formed. This developmental glitch is apt for a band so obsessed with the vagaries of evolution.Many bands spend their 20s exploring emotional states, placing themselves at the exact center of the universe. Rahim take a broader, more aloof view, regarding their lives as blips in a vast, chaotic system. Instead of friends, enemies, and lovers, they only see architecture rising and falling-- civilizations, too. It's not that the emotional is absent in Rahim's music, they simply don't give it much credence: \"My friends are beautiful, but they all know/ That they're all accidents...\" Evolutionary developments, not emotional ones, are the pendulum they use to mark time. \"500,000 years on land/ 500,000 years and we grow back again.\"Rahim's position is essentially amoral: If everything's an accident, no one's accountable. But their finesse with these weighty themes makes them more than nihilistic; they strive for meaning even as they reject it. The ceremonial \"Vision\" makes an oblique case for human continuity. A verse about atavistic rituals sets up a chorus that's worth quoting at length: \"Each change in my world/ As the sea has changed before/ I remember every word in my simple way/ Frenzied as we were/ Did we see this view before?/ I remember without benefit of vision.\" Even if existence is an accident, we can still locate patterns, echoes, and connections. These moments, when Rahim discovers traces of value in the process of tearing it down, are redemptive.album's musical light-footedness also helps its ponderous themes go down easier. Singer Michael Friedrich's slightly nasal voice is a bit like Elvis Costello's, and he wraps it around surprisingly mobile melodies, making this the rare post-punk record that you can hum. The band's guitar parts are spiky and spangled, but avoid the genre-pitfall of rigidity; they actually swing a bit, in periodic surges and glides. Tactful horns, synth washes, and vibraphones ruffle the limber yet ironclad core instrumentation like faint updrafts. Instead of variations on clangor, we get genuine diversity: \"The Same\" drones majestically, \"Tired Man\" slouches with the aid of wheezy synths, and \"Of Course\" shaggily unfurls.Rahim seem to take the same bird's-eye view of their albums as they do of history. They have perceived album as whole and enlivened it, strategically, with inventive embellishments. Drummer Phil Sutton deserves a lot of the credit on this score-- he's great at dropping in a few agile clicks or subtle cowbells to unobtrusively color or complicate a rhythmic structure. One of the album's best moments comes on \"Cities Change\": on the last word of the verse, the whole band goes \"woof\" as the drum pattern retreats to the rim, making a pivot that slingshots us into the chorus. (\"Woof\" sounds silly on paper, but it really does sound awesome on the record.) It's kind of funny that, despite album's evolutionary themes, its merits owe equally to its intelligent design.\n",
            "A common lament amongst music fans is that certain albums would be greatly improved if only the artist had cut certain songs from the tracklist. But album, the sophomore full-length from San Diego-based lo-fi pop group The Robot Ate Me, marks the first occurrence I know of for which the band has made the distinction between their worthwhile and subpar tracks so staggeringly clear. To this curious end, album is spread over two discs: The first indulges all the pretenses for which many people dismiss lo-fi indie rock completely: half-baked noodling in the name of experimentation; painfully ironic lyrics for songs with titles like \"name\" and \"I Slept Through the Holocaust\", and loads of novelty instrumentation. In marked contrast, The Robot Ate Me cut the shit on the second disc to offer their best songs yet. The band's 2002 debut, They Ate Themselves, was nothing if not promising: The Robot Ate Me consists of three clearly intelligent musicians, and as that disc showed, when they take the extra time to structure their good ideas and censor their bad ones, their music comes out creative, compelling and often stunningly catchy. With album's second disc, they seem to have realized this themselves, crafting songs rewarding enough to forgive the first disc's utter tripe entirely. Compare disc one's hissy emo closer, \"album\", with the second disc's upbeat and clever opener of the same name: Drummer Dave Greenberg's jumpy hi-hat swish is pushed way back in the mix, making room for Ryland Bouchard's perfectly shaky, bittersweet delivery. Deadpan lines like, \"Let's go back home to where it's familiar/ I can't take this bright burning sun,\" work brilliantly here, stringing out fantastic lyrical/musical tension that felt so clumsily and obviously executed on the first disc. \"Apricot Tea\" is the lush sibling track to disc two's \"album\". Bouchard is still dead-on here, but with an even more curious rubato for his introductory remarks: \"If you want to lie at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, I'll/ Be the one that comes with my ship and be the one that drops the anchor down.\" What follows is a thick but wispy vocal chorus of disembodied, wordless harmonizing that forms the waterfall backdrop for the song's anthemic line, \"Oh, will you be the one that smiles for me?\", which provides the record's biggest and best hook. The album closer, \"I'm Ok\", employs Chris Meng's tasteful banjo accompaniment as the glue for the song's many moods, and jumps back and forth through various crosshatchings of Bouchard's simultaneous joy and despair in the song's chorus line, \"Hey, I'm all right down here.../ And really, it's ok.\" This is The Robot Ate Me's most robust song, and a promising end to an album that so unnecessarily wades through its own detritus on disc one to fully showcase itself on disc two. Maybe there's a point to album's disparity, or some subtle concept behind it that has to this very sentence remained elusive. But if there isn't one, The Robot Ate Me should feel free to skip the noise and cut straight to their songs next time-- when they want to be, they're actually quite good.\n",
            "Every morning, Detroit tech-house artist Matthew Dear has to wake up to the painful realization that, for the rest of his career, he might never again release anything as good as \"Dog Days\". This is hardly a slight to Dear-- \"Dog Days\" just happens to be one of the most irresistible house numbers to come out in years, and the song casts a long, pitch-black shadow over the rest of his work. Even Dear's 2003 solid debut LP, Leave Luck to Heaven, which tried to keep \"Dog Days\" tucked away until the sixth track, ultimately suffered from this emergent disparity. Dear definitely feels the pressure. After Leave Luck to Heaven, he tried his best to match the hook and energy of \"Dog Days\" with the feisty 12-inch single \"Anger Management\". The fractured acid-house groove had just as much energy as \"Dog Days\", but lacked Dear's breathy vocal hook, relying instead on the warmth of the synth sounds themselves. B-side \"Future Never Again\" fared similarly with gorgeous high- and low-end production, and from the release, it seemed that Dear had decided to forgo the \"Dog Days\" formula entirely and instead to concentrate on this very exciting warm acid-house approach. Dear's abrasive debut Kisses EP as Audion only fortified this expectation, the 12-inch bearing the faint hint of a denser, club-friendlier Pan Sonic. Given this trajectory, Dear's new album LP comes with two surprises: For one, Dear relies much more heavily on his vocals to carry the songs than before-- more than half of these tracks prominently feature his vocals. What consciously results are Dear's first pop songs, most of which make recourse to traditional verse/chorus/verse structure. The other surprise is more frustrating: Dear's instrumental tracks are remarkably flat. They hardly match the energy of \"Anger Management\" or Kisses, let alone Dear's fantastic earlier EPs. What's worse, since the instrumentals come between the vocal tracks, an otherwise exciting album suffers from some serious drag. The torrent of noise that delays opener \"Another\" for over a minute finally gives way to a pulse of timid synth straight out of Warp's back catalog. Dear updates the line halfway through with a bubbly glitch treatment, but given the line's fragility, he can't do much else with it, and the song stagnates. Dear himself must have realized this about \"Another\"; in fact, the vinyl release of album pulls it from the tracklist altogether. Percussion sounds on \"name\" fire off and recoil while Dear snakes a simple but gargantuan bassline and some twitchy guitar action into the mix. By the time Dear enters in verse with modest reverb, the song's chorus is about to take over: The guitar drops out, and Dear's catchy nanny-nanny boo-boo potshot (\"I don't care 'bout you anymore\") is closely followed by a trail of deadened vocals, used to bewilderingly great effect. Unfortunately, what life \"name\" manages to breathe into album is enervated by \"Takes on You\", a seven-minute instrumental that boasts the precision of Kompakt but none of its heart. Dear won't reclaim the listener's rapt attention until \"Grut Wall\". Here, Dear contrasts trench-deep but well-defined low-end with bright clicks, while a tired bee-like buzz flutters between the two. Shortly thereafter, the song's colorful electric piano melody-- perhaps a sinister counterpart to Jurgen Pääpe's line on \"So Weit Wie Noch Wie\"-- settles in for good. \"Grut Wall\" would have killed even as an instrumental, but Dear's exorcised vocals send it rocketing up to meet \"name\" as an album highlight. After \"Grut Wall\", album becomes particularly disappointing. \"I Know Howser\" is Dear's lazy attempt at schaffel-pop; the possibly tongue-in-cheek \"Huggy's Parade\" is an undeveloped, infantile \"Dog Days\" rehash; and there's not much to say about \"Good Girl\" other than that it's just fucking terrible. Thankfully, the album's epic closer, \"And in the Night\", redeems some of the album's second-side sins. Though definitely out of place on album-- it sounds more like an overloaded Happy Mondays than the minimal house approach to which Dear primarily subscribes-- its storm of horns, keyboards, bell sounds, and tape hiss work quite well behind Dear's multitracked vocal melodies. It's unclear if \"And in the Night\" marks a new direction for Dear or just a fluke, but it stands as one last reminder here of how much Dear is capable as an artist. In this sense, album could become even more of a burden to Dear: The album makes it strikingly clear when he's dead on, and when he's miles off.\n",
            " Mark E. Smith has helmed the Fall for a full 30 years. It's pretty mind-blowing to think of them as the institution they've become-- this band has always been so strange, prolific, and unpredictable, and Smith has built his oddball ranting into a sort of brand by sheer force of will. Because of the group's constantly shifting lineups, they've just as capable of releasing several masterpieces in a row as they'd be following them up with two puzzling disasters. Since signing to Narnack in 2003, the Fall had been on one of their good runs: 2004's Real New Fall LP was their best album in ages, Smith had assembled players with nearly as much punch and muscle as the Burns/Hanley/Rogers/Scanlon/Brix crew that made the band's greatest stretch of classic in the early to mid-80s, and 2005's Fall Heads Roll was a solid second act in Smith's mini-renaissance. The Fall were storming across America with all cylinders firing in 2006 when something strange happened: Smith and his keyboardist/wife Eleni Poulou woke up in Phoenix to find the rest of the band gone, back to the UK unannounced. Only the band members know what happened to make them leave-- and Smith does have a history of cantankerous relations with his musicians-- but at any rate, Smith and Poulou were stuck in the U.S. in the middle of a tour with no rhythm section. So they kept touring, naturally. The first thing to realize is that the Fall aren't really a band in the usual sense. It's MES & Musicians Currently in His Favour, so he and Poulou simply scraped together some guitarists and a drummer and kept going. They wound up going right into a long-scheduled studio session in L.A. as well, where they cut Reformation Post TLC. Remember a few sentences ago when I said the Fall isn't really a band in the usual sense? Well, on this record they don't sound like one, either. With only a few exceptions, the album is a mess, and not a very memorable one at that. I think Smith is referencing the United States of America's \"Coming Down\" on opener \"Over! Over!\" when he sings \"I think it's over now I think it's...ending,\" but you'd be hard-pressed to call it a tribute, at least in the same way his covers of \"Victoria\", \"Mr. Pharmacist\", and \"I Can Hear the Grass Grow\" have been in the past. Much more troubling, though, is Smith's tendency to fall back on using slurred speech and growls whenever he runs out of things to say. He does the wookie thing on \"Over! Over!\" and a few other songs, and it's just annoying, the kind of thing he may wind up getting away with because, you know, he's Mark E. Smith. But I'm not buying it in part because even when he is saying something, he's not saying much. He sounds tired and unfocused on most of the record, and when he cedes the vocals to Poulou on \"The Wright Stuff\", she basically imitates him, rambling over the backing track. More damaging than Smith's unusually incoherent performance, though, is the production. The only thing that's uniform about it is that it's lousy. The sound on the album is all over the place, and ranges from muffled to unevenly mixed-- the mastering level on certain tracks even sounds different from the level on others. There are things about the new band, even in the inchoate state it was captured in here, that sound promising, so it's a shame the texture is so scattered. The aptly named \"Fall Sound\" features a vintage Fall groove, with the whole band locked in tightly, guitars nagging at the edges of a thick bass line, but Smith doesn't do much with it, gargling on the intro and wandering in and out of his usual sneering deadpan. You almost wonder if he's just telling the truth when he shouts, \"It's a scream for help that's desperate.\" \"White Line Fever\"'s country aesthetic is somewhat interesting but it needed more time in the oven-- if they develop this angle, it could be a good new direction. Going into much more detail than that doesn't serve the record well, but suffice to say that \"Das Bootuboat\" is the worst Fall track this decade; it trudges through a sludge bath of bass, wobbly sound effects, jokey chanting, and other sonic muck. It sounds like an incidental track when it stops around two minutes in, but then it comes back for another eight minutes to go nowhere slowly all over again. More than anything, it seems as though this version of Fall is ill-served by the first album it made. There are moments of clarity when the band sounds fantastic, but they're not enough to save the record from landing in the band's forget pile. The rhythm section can play its guts out, but if Mark E. Smith isn't leading the charge and dripping acid, it won't come to much good. Reformation Post TLC is ultimately a record that was made out of stubbornness, and one that almost certainly could have been better if they'd taken more time to write and rehearse it before recording it. \n",
            "As the elder statesperson for Britain's trad-rock community, Paul Weller doesn't have a whole lot left to prove. His place in the rock canon was already sealed by his music with the Jam, his work with the Style Council was laudably adventurous-- even if their last couple of records were total disasters-- and he recovered from the debacle of that band's demise nicely in the early 90s by getting back to basics, turning to his love of old r&b; and Small Faces guitar pop for inspiration. album is Weller's eighth studio solo album, and it does very little that you could call unexpected, but does it all very well nonetheless. Following the inconsequential covers album Studio 150, it's a welcome return to form, harking back to the straight-ahead rock'n'roll of 1997's Heavy Soul with shades of the mellow craft that dominated 2002's Illumination. Weller's husky voice still handles the charging rockers nicely, but it's the more subtle ballads like the searching, Mellotron-soaked \"Pan\" where he really shines and gets to use his range to its fullest effect. \"I Wanna Make It Alright\" is one of several songs that hint at Weller's love of jazz, loping along with a swinging gait as pianos whiz about in the background and he sings in a falsetto. \"Roll Along Summer\" goes even further in that direction, centering on a fluttering alto sax solo and loose-limbed drumming that smoothly underpins Weller's swooping vocals. The alto sax makes a grittier appearance on the the seven-minute groover \"Bring Back the Funk\", a track that suffers from lyrics as ill-considered as the title. By the 20th time Weller sings \"We gotta bring back the funk, ya'll/ We gotta bring back the love ya'll,\" you'll wish it was an instrumental. Still, it beats his perplexing order to \"sing you little fuckers/ Sing like you got no choice\" on the brittle trad-rock of \"Come On/Let's Go\". So it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but even when the lyrics are tolerable at best it's tough to argue with lean rockers like \"Blink and You'll Miss it\" and \"From the Floorboards Up\", both of which showcase monster choruses and plenty of winding, heavily distorted lead guitar. What really struck me as I listened to album, though, is how much it grew on me. Where on the first listen I found it merely okay, it's a record that reveals itself as a work of surprising depth and detail when you give it multiple spins and start noticing things like the clever trombone counterpoint in the verses of \"Here's the Good News\". For a guy with nothing left to prove, Weller sounds determined not to fade away, and as long as he keeps making records like this every couple of years, there's no danger of that happening.\n",
            "It's impressive what Russian Circles can do with a basic guitar, bass, and drum setup. There are plenty of metal-leaning instrumental bands who dial up big climaxes, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one that creates such an array of textures and emotions with so little. Bassist Brian Cook also uses keyboards, and on the Chicago trio's excellent fifth album, album, they bring in guest cello and violin. But the core, buttressed by imaginative arrangements and strong compositional skills, is strong enough that there would be more than enough chills without these add-ons.The collection follows 2011's Empros. That was a strong effort, too; the eight tracks here, though, feel more polished and fluid, bigger and yet somehow more intimate—even though the pristine recording, again by longtime producer Brandon Curtis, also fits well with the vast, mountainous cover art. Empros had a swing to it, a groove that bled between tracks even when they got darker or heavier. album offers more pronounced dynamics in both directions—the metal moments frenzied, the quiet parts somber and restrained—and instead of offering a push or pull, it goes for higher star-melting theatrics. In that regard, you'd have to place them in the company of Explosions in the Sky, another band that can create compelling narratives without words.Russian Circles do seem to be telling a story here. The clean guitars and strings on brief opener \"Memoriam\" make it feel like a eulogy, and the remaining songs offer the various emotions that come with loss (anger, panic, nostalgia, pain). \"Memoriam\" is an airy piece that jarringly shifts into the heavy, lurching \"Deficit\", an almost seven-minute track that, like \"Mladek\" on Empros, shows you that they have no trouble breaking into a black metal blur. They conjure the Fucking Champs and go explosion-for-explosion with the aforementioned post-rock titans.It's followed by the longest and best song on the album, the seven-and-a-half minute \"1777\". This piece opens with loud, crisp drums that are reminiscent of early Tortoise—John McEntire locking into a groove for a snare-drunk 20 minutes. Cascading guitars and a steady bass circle it, adding a sense of flight to the grounded beats. The dynamics here are reminiscent of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, who also balance darkness and muck with a sense of the sublime. The slow-motion crescendo at the five-and-a-half-minute mark, the additional layers of spiraling guitars, and chaotically controlled drums could build for another hour and not get boring.You don't get anything that great on the rest of the album; that said, it's an emotional peak you only need to reach once on a collection like this, and the restraint on the following tracks helps with the overall thematic. For instance, the somber, melancholic \"Cheyenne\" is a doomier, more spacious and cinematic song, like 2013 Earth collaborating with Mogwai. The mathy \"Burial\" is heavier, angrier, and complete with pick slides. This may be the album's real climax, at least mentally—during it, you're thinking about the suffocation in death, and not the release. It feeds into the romantic, ethereal \"Ethel\" and the rocker, \"name\". On album, the more they move away from the straight-up rock moments and into more ambitious constructions, the stronger it feels.The collection closes with vocals from labelmate Chelsea Wolfe on \"album\". It's a chilly, pretty piece that, like the opener, adds a softness to the record, along with a sonic and thematic echo. Wolfe, whispering and layered, sounds great per usual, but her vocal turn confirms something important: Unlike a bunch of bands who opt to go it without a singer, these guys really don't need one.\n",
            "Pontificating at length about the colossal sadness of Elliott Smith's discography might seem reductive or stupidly obvious, but \"sad\" still stands as the single most accurate label ever slapped onto any of the late singer/songwriter's records. Smith's melancholy is big, pervasive and suffocating: see strummed chords and meekly mewed verses coated in thick, gloppy layers of heartbreak, lyrics hanging heavy with cold defeat, vocals seeped in doom. Even the simplicity of Smith's songs can be oddly disheartening-- the pretty bits always conceal grim, prickly underbellies, with Smith's melodic lightness tempered by the very worst kind of self-alienation. Pop music has enjoyed a long and tenuous relationship with sadness-as-aesthetic-anchor, and Elliott Smith's role in that lineage was obvious from the start. It was forever preserved the moment that an obviously misplaced Smith stumbled onto the Academy Awards stage sporting an awkward, ill-fitting white suit. Now, nearly a year after his presumed suicide, Elliott Smith has come to occupy a painfully specific spot in our collective pop memory, curled up alongside spiritual brethren Kurt Cobain and Nick Drake-- all somber songwriters who realized their artistic ends in hideously relevant ways, fulfilling every last one of the dismal prophecies they wrote themselves into. And, as with Cobain and Drake, the most devastating part of Elliott Smith's death wasn't the knife slammed deep into his chest, but the bland inevitability of that motion-- how nobody was surprised, how things felt so \"validated,\" how it was disgustingly appropriate, how we were all just waiting for it. Unsurprisingly, From a Basement on the Hill-- Smith's posthumous sixth solo album-- doesn't break form: Released uncomfortably close to the one-year anniversary of his death, the album is riddled with helpless proclamations and self-incriminating taunts, clanging guitars and foggy, jumbled arrangements. Like nearly all of Smith's records, From a Basement covers his despair in sweet, perky, folk-pop kisses; and yet the album is still the saddest thing you'll hear all year. Smith's gloom may be romanticized into gold, but what's ultimately most harrowing about his unhappiness is its nastiness-- and that same gritty, uncompromising accuracy is also what makes his records so impossibly urgent, so uncomfortable and desperate. Reality is splattered all over From a Basement on the Hill-- dissonant guitars that sometimes coalesce and sometimes clash, vocals that flit from beautiful to strained, lyrics that range from clever to pedantic, production choices that hop maniacally from right to wrong. For whatever reason, Smith's happier moments have always felt a little meaner than his darkest. They're somehow more smirking and cruel, as if they'd been put in place as pure provocation. Even the lightest tracks here (see the excellent \"King's Crossing\", or the barely-there \"Memory Lane\") are bogged down by their own sense of inevitability, or maybe by our own-- it's almost impossible not to judge From a Basement on the Hill without first acknowledging the complicated context of its release, cringing at its song titles, and promptly biting back presumptive words like \"foreshadowing.\" Supposedly, Smith had finished most of the work on From a Basement before his death last October, and the completed tracks were posthumously compiled by his immediate family and mixed by one-time girlfriend/present-day Jicks member Joanna Bolme and longtime producer Rob Schnapf (\"final production\" is credited only to \"Elliott's family and friends\"). And perhaps surprisingly, From a Basement on the Hill is perfectly coherent and cohesive, without any sense of being slapped together from half-finished parts. The record even boasts a classic Smith opener, the booming and majestic \"name\", which swells in and out in a haze of guitar ping and found sound murmurs. Collaborating again with former Heatmiser bandmate (and current Quasi member) Sam Coomes, \"Pretty (Ugly Before)\" weds tinkling piano with goofy guitar bits and lyrics that are somehow equally disheartened and optimistic (\"Sunshine/ Been keeping me up for days/ There's no nighttime/ It's only a passing phase\"). Still, the most disheartening thing about From a Basement on the Hill is its plainness-- it's neither a perfect record (and not one of Smith's best) nor the kind of colossal disaster that could be angrily pinned on money-hungry handlers and desperate fans. It's likely that Elliott Smith will be resurrected and rediscovered countless times over, and that his suicide will become as big a part of his legacy as his discography, feeding the mythology, informing the songs. But while From a Basement on the Hill will certainly have a place in that tradition, its impact will prove a stark contrast to his most affecting work.\n",
            "The term “transatlanticism” was coined by Ben Gibbard to define the incomprehensible emotional gap between two lovers separated by comprehensible distances—the continental United States, an entire ocean, or, most likely, just a couple floors in your freshman dorm. In the 10 years since Death Cab For Cutie released their finest record, the title has taken on an unintended resonance in regards to their career. On one side of their fourth of seven studio albums, there are three modestly performed and admirably successful LPs released on Seattle indie label Barsuk. On the other, three exquisite-sounding and wildly successful LPs released on New York City major...Atlantic. Death Cab’s aesthetic hadn’t really changed all that much, and yet how do you span the distance between the uber-#feelings video for “A Movie Script Ending” and two #1 albums (Codes and Keys hit #3), Grammy nominations, platinum sales when they meant something, huge festival slots, and Zooey Deschanel? Look, it’s nigh impossible to extricate Death Cab’s ascendance from The O.C., so how’s this: from the moment the skyrocket guitars go off in “name”, Death Cab are taking a leap of faith like Seth Cohen up on that kissing booth, risking embarrassment to tell as many people as possible that they may be dorks, but they’re not going to be anyone’s secret anymore.Up until 2001's The Photo Album, Death Cab created often excellent songs that did a limited number of things—they didn’t rock (nor did they really try), they didn’t groove, their blood didn’t run particularly hot either, even when Gibbard sang about abusive parents, any number of lost loves, or hatred for his future hometown of Los Angeles. On album, well, not much really changed. But Walla in particular found countless ways to work around it. We all know Summer Roberts’ “it’s like one guitar and a whole lot of complaining” wisecrack helped Death Cab far more than it ever hurt them, but what always bothered me was the idea that they ever sounded like one guy. Death Cab songs are nearly impossible to accurately recreate in a solo performance and if the rinky-dink demos (hear “We Looked Like Giants” and the title track with 8-bit drums!) included in the reissue prove anything, it’s that.Walla takes advantage of all the band’s moving parts, ensuring each one has its own distinct sonic character and turning album into a downright indulgent listen, a grand buffet of texture and tone. On the whole, the band creates perfectly detailed sonic dioramas—from the piano punctuating the pregnant quietude of “Passenger Seat”, you feel a frozen forest night in the middle of winter. “name” captures explosions off in the distance and the ambivalence of wondering why you can’t relate to them. Within these ornate arrangements, a clever addition sneaks in towards the end and steals the song—the xylophone that rearranges the melody of “Title and Registration”, the combination of handclaps and slashing guitars on “The Sound of Settling”, and especially the percussion, whether those of new drummer Jason McGerr or the mechanistic electronics (beyond its profile boost, the concurrent musical influence of Gibbard’s work in the Postal Service tends to be overstated).It reveals much of their work leading up to album as test runs—the simple Death Cab + drum machine format of “Coney Island” or the Stability EP are upgraded to complex, mixed-meter rhythms on “Lightness” and “Death of an Interior Decorator”. On “Bend to Squares”, “Title Track”, “Styrofoam Plates” (and later, “Marching Bands of Manhattan” and “Bixby Canyon Bridge”), Death Cab developed a trick where they’d build and build and build without ever exploding into pure catharsis. The consuming title track unapologetically goes over-the-top, giving you a safe and sound drop on the most sincere, intense FaceTime conversation ever: those glistening guitars and the endless, upward ramp of the drums convey enough infinite sadness as is, and then a church choir comes in to goad the listener: will these two EVER just make out already?Walla was expanding his scope and ambition, intersecting with Gibbard, who was doing the same as a writer. It didn’t initially seem that way: though this record gained Death Cab many, many new fans, it lost some older ones as well, and in our original review of album, William Morris echoed their sentiments, taking issue with the increased generality of Gibbard’s lyrics. And there’s truth to that, as album is full of compact ways to express the same ideas that Death Cab songs would earlier obfuscate with bigger words or dense metaphor: “So this is the new year/ and I don’t feel any different,” “I need you so much closer,” and of course, “She is beautiful, but she don’t mean a thing to me.” That said, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone else capable of pulling off Gibbard’s more typically elliptical concepts. A disastrous wedding “felt just like falling in love again” to the lonely empty nester on “Death of an Interior Decorator”. “Title and Registration” begins with a silly joke and it’s revealed as a defense mechanism as Gibbard recalls how the dumbest thing (like, “searching for some legal documents”) can unearth a wellspring of repressed feelings. It’s a phenomenon that can cause you to lose hours at a time, and “Title” sums it up perfectly in four minutes.As a result of pulling all those heartstrings, short of the Decemberists, no band has become an easier target for people who want to assert their “I ain’t with that indie bullshit” masculinity. Granted, Death Cab For Cutie’s music never sounds sexual, and you can’t really call it “rock music” as something derived from “rhythm and blues”—hell, they’ve always been an awkward fit into “emo” as a musical ideal, since that entails some basis in punk and Death Cab clearly have nothing of the sort. And that’s fine, as Gibbard sought to create the definitive songs about the span of a romantic coupling rather than a sonic approximation of it. Whereas the previous albums dealt with mundane, household affairs—reading the unemployment pages, sharing cigarettes, “We Laugh Indoors”—a lot more’s at stake this time out, emotionally and physically. Death Cab thrashes desperately throughout “We Looked Like Giants” while Gibbard recalls both the thrall of hormonal, visceral lust and the painful recollection of the liminal moments spent around jukeboxes and magazines. Wavering sonar beeps cloak low-key amorousness on “Lightness”. And, oh man…\"Tiny Vessels.”A common criticism of Death Cab (and really, its fanbase) is that wimpiness served as a cover for passive-aggressiveness or a safe haven from actually acting on emotions or impulses and risking rejection—if not outright misogyny. “Tiny Vessels” doesn’t exactly negate that criticism, it just forces the issue by putting it right out there. Though he'd reconfigure the “I spent two weeks in Silver Lake” line after his divorce from Zooey Deschanel, that's an exception, as one of Gibbard’s strengths is that his lyrics can be rich with personalized detail without sounding personal. That said, his vocals always lead you to believe that the narrator at least kinda looks like him and it's startling to hear Gibbard detail the kind of callous sexual conquest people think they're escaping by getting into the indie crowd.The entire band is in peak form on \"Tiny Vessels\"—a glancing, sour note in the introductory guitar harmony precedes the unsympathetic admission that you're no different than the narrator, that \"you'll tell her that you love her but you don't.\" Time-elapse layering of shockingly distorted guitars raise the drama during the bridge as he “wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking/ As we moved together in the dark.” That gets most of the attention, though it’s the spellbinding third verse where all of it clears out, leaving plangent, echoing drums that house the monstrous, hollowed-out sentiment of Gibbard’s lyric—that of a total jerk who’s very aware of the thoughts and feelings of the other person, but chooses not to stop himself. It’s understandable that many people either can’t or choose not to acknowledge both sides of “Tiny Vessels”, and every time a Death Cab live crowd turns it to a singalong (and it’s usually one of the loudest), it becomes one of the most biting indictment of “nice guy syndrome” ever written.We’ve gotten this far, so let’s just do away with it: judging Death Cab, and album in particular, from a completely objective standpoint feels kinda insincere and wholly inaccurate (and everybody knows it). From a lot of the descriptors above, “indulgent,” “consuming,” etc.—you can assume that, yeah, I was completely obsessed with album back in 2003. It was in a way that should be embarrassing in retrospect, but why judge your younger self like that? If the “little brother/sister music” tag often applied to Death Cab is going to stick, at least remember the times when your world was that small where new love (or a broken heart) filled its entirety and thensome. Or maybe that a new love shrinks your world to the point where there isn’t room for anything else. Note the central simile in “We Looked Like Giants”, two people “in the back of [a] gray subcompact/ fumbling to make contact” don’t have a lot of space to consider politics, socioeconomic struggle, whatever you consider to be “important” matters for art to discern.I mean, I can bust out a map and point out the mountain passes of Virginia’s I-64 that I’d brave after skipping early classes or talk about the resonance of “Title and Registration” in relation to the November day in 2003 I spent getting my automotive legal documents in order or how I first heard the title track on the way to a college reunion, for crying out loud. Serendipity, for sure—but few records open themselves up to forge those kind of moments, to be a formative emotional and listening experience, pushing you to feel what you’re thinking (to flip a line from “Lightness”), daring to be universal enough to allow you to see yourself in it. If you love this album, or will, you’ll have some a personal history of your own and that’s why album stands out over Death Cab’s impressive catalog—they were always great at telling you stories, but here, they proved even better at helping you understand your own.\n"
